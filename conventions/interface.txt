Interface conventions
---------------------
---------------------

Default options
---------------

Every tool should provide the following options:
  -h, --help            display help information
      --version         display version information
  -q, --quiet           do not display warning messages
  -v, --verbose         turn on the display of short intermediate messages
  -d, --debug           turn on the display of detailed intermediate messages


Input and output files
----------------------

Every non-interactive tool that provides non-trivial input and output, should
be of the following form:

tool [OPTION]... [INFILE [OUTFILE]]

If the user does not specify OUTFILE, the output has to be written to stdout.
If the user also does not specify INFILE, the input has to be read from stdin.

It is only allowed to deviate from this rule if it is technically infeasible
to read from stdin or write to stdout.

Furthermore, the following features are forbidden:
- designate the input file without its extension, e.g.
    wrong: "mcrl22lpe abp"
    right: "mcrl22lpe abp.mcrl2"
- option '-' to indicate input should be read from stdin, e.g.
    wrong: "... | lperewr - abp.rewr.lpe"
    right: "... | lperewr > abp.rewr.lpe"


File formats
------------

To provide users with a consistent way of handling files, the following
extensions should be used only for corresponding purpose:
  .mcrl2                mCRL2 specification
  .lpe                  mCRL2 LPE
  .svc                  LTS in SVC format
  .aut                  LTS in AUT format
  .trc                  trace for simulation
  .dot                  GraphViz format
  .mcrl                 mCRL specification
  .tbf                  mCRL LPE
  .pnml                 PNML specification


Version information
-------------------

Version information should be displayed as follows:

tool VERSION (revision REV)

Here VERSION is the version of the toolset and REV the latest revision number
of the whole toolset.


Feedback
--------

To provide users with a consistent way of giving feedback, the address
bug@mcrl2.org should be used.


Referring to mCRL
-----------------

When referring to mCRL, type it as such. Do not use muCRL.
When referring to mCRL LPEs, type it as such. Do not use LPO, or tbf. tbf may
only be used to indicate the file format.
