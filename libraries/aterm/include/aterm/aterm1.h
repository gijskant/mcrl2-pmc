/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * The ATerm library is an open-source library for term manipulation.
 * This C version of the library implements the four standard serialization
 * interfaces, features a generational garbage collector and maximal subterm
 * sharing.
 *
 * It is important to realize that the ATerm interface is fully 'functional',
 * which means that all variables of type ATerms should be regarded as
 * VALUES by the programmer, not pointers. ATerms are never updated
 * destructively. The only side-effects of the ATerm API are the
 * administration of maximal subterm sharing and garbage collection, both
 * are hidden from the programmer.
 *
 * The major blessing AND pitfall of ATerm programming is automatic garbage
 * collection. The garbage
 * collector automatically finds all living terms that are rooted somewhere
 * on the
 * C call stack (which means they are local variables in one of your
 * functions). Global variables, or ATerm members of your own structures
 * that are allocated on the heap need to be protected from garbage collection
 * by ATprotect(), and unprotected again when their context is freed by
 * ATunprotect().

 * Definition of the level 1 interface of the ATerm library. This interface
 * basically implements the make & match paradigm for constructing and
 * deconstructing ATerms. It is an easy interface but not optimized for
 * run-time efficiency.
 *
 * \section index Start with the following functions
 *    - ATinit() should be called from your main() function
 *    - ATmake() to construct terms.  Now deprecated and removed.
 *    - ATmatch() to deconstruct terms. Deprecated and removed.
  *    - ATprotect() to protect global variable from the garbage collector
 *    - ATreadFromNamedFile to read terms from disk
