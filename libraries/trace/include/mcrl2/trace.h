/// \brief Formats in which traces can be saved on disk
/// \details Formats in which traces can be saved on disk. There are several formats for traces.
/// The tfMcrl2 format saves a trace as an mCRL2 term in ATerm internal format.
/// This is a compact but unreadable format.
/// The tfPlain format is an ascii representation of the trace, which is
/// human readable but only contains the actions and no time or state information. 
/// tfUnknown is only used to read traces, when it is
/// not known what the format is. In this case it is determined based
/// on the format of the input file.
enum TraceFormat 
  { tfMcrl2,  /**< Format is stored as an ATerm */
    tfPlain,  /**< Format is stored in plain text. In this format there are only actions */
    tfUnknown /**< This value indicates that the format is unknown */
  };

/// \brief This class contains a trace consisting of a sequence of (timed) actions possibly with intermediate states
/// \details This class contains a trace. A trace is a sequence of actions. Actions can have a time
/// tag as a positive real number. Between two actions, before the first action and after the last
/// action there can be a state. In the current version of the trace library an action, a state and
/// a time tag are arbitrary expressions of sort AtermAppl. It is expected that this will change
/// in the near future to match the data types used in the LPS library.
/// 
/// An important property of a state is its current position. All operations on a state
/// operate with respect to its current position. A trace can be traversed by increasing
/// and decreasing the current position between 0 up to the length. If a new action is
/// added to a trace, the trace above the current position is lost. For each action
/// a state can only be added once.
///
/// States can be saved in two formats. A human readable ascii format containging only a
/// sequence of untimed actions and a more compact ATerm format also containing time and
/// state information.
