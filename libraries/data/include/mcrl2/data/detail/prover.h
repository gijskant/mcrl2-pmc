/// \brief An enumerated type respresenting the answers "yes", "no" and "undefined".
/// The term "formula" in the following text denotes arbitrary expressions of sort Bool in the mCRL2 format.
///
/// The Prover class is a base class for provers. Provers take formulas as input and indicate if these formulas are
/// tautologies or contradictions. Since provers are not necessarily complete, a prover can be unable to determine if a
/// formula is a tautology or a contradiction for some formulas. If this is the case, the prover will indicate this fact.
/// A prover uses a rewriter to rewrite parts of the formulas it manipulates. The constructor Prover::Prover initializes
/// the prover's rewriter with the data equations in internal mCRL2 format passed as parameter a_equations and the rewrite
/// strategy passed as parameter a_strategy. To limit the number of seconds spent on proving a single formula, a time
/// limit can be set. This time limit can be set initially by the constructor Prover::Prover and can be changed afterwards
/// using the method Prover::set_time_limit. If the time limit is set to 0, no time limit will be enforced.
///
/// Once a prover is created, the formula to be proven can be set using the method Prover::set_formula. The method
/// Prover::set_formula takes a propositional formula in internal mCRL2 format as parameter a_formula.
///
/// The methods Prover::is_tautology and Prover::is_contradiction can then indicate whether or not this formula is a
/// tautology or a contradiction. These methods will return answer_yes, answer_no or answer_undefined.
///
/// If a formula is neither a tautology nor a contradiction according to the prover, a so called witness or counter
/// example can be returned by the methods Prover::get_witness and Prover::get_counter_example. A witness is a valuation
/// for which the formula holds, a counter example is a valuation for which it does not hold.
