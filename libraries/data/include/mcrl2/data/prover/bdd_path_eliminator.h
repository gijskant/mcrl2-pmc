  /** \brief Base class for eliminating inconsistent paths from BDDs.
   *
   * \detail
   * The class BDD_Path_Eliminator is a base class for classes that
   * eliminate inconsistent paths from BDDs. The class
   * BDD_Path_Eliminator inherits from the class BDD_Simplifier. It uses
   * an SMT solver to eliminate inconsistent paths from BDDs. The
   * parameter a_solver_type of the constructor
   * BDD_Path_Eliminator::BDD_Path_Eliminator is used to indicate which
   * SMT solver should be used for this task. A path in a BDD is
   * constructed by selecting a set of guards as follows: starting at
   * the root node, one of the two edges at each guard is followed until
   * a leaf is reached. Each time the true-edge is chosen, the guard is
   * added to the set. Each time the false-edge is chosen, the negation
   * of the guard is added to the set. If the conjunction of all
   * elements in this set is a contradiction, the path
   * is inconsistent.

   * The method BDD_Path_Eliminator::simplify receives a BDD as
   * parameter a_bdd and returns the equivalent BDD from which all
   * inconsistent paths have been removed.
