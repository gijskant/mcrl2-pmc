[section:algorithms Algorithms]

In this section we define algorithms for boolean equation systems.

[section:gauss_elimination Gauss elimination]
The class `gauss_elimination_algorithm` in the header file `mcrl2/pbes/gauss_elimination_algorithm.h`
implements Gauss elimination for fixpoint equation systems.
