    /** \brief A class that takes a linear process specification and checks all tau-summands of that LPS for confluence.
        \brief The tau actions of all confluent tau-summands are renamed to ctau.
       
         Given an LPS,
       
           P(d: D) = ...
                   + sum ei: Ei. ci(d, ei) -> ai(fi(d, ei)) . P(gi(d, ei))
                   + ...
                   + sum ej: Ej. cj(d, ej) -> tau . P(gj(d, ej))
                   + ...;
         
       
        tau-summand j is confluent with summand i if the following condition holds for all d: D, for all ei: Ei and for all
         ej: Ej:
       
           (inv(d) /\ ci(d, ei) /\ cj(d, ej))
           =>
           (
            ci(gj(d, ej), ei) /\ 
            cj(gi(d, ei), ej) /\ 
            fi(d, ei) == fi(gj(d, ej), ei) /\ 
            gi(gj(d, ej), ei) == gj(gi(d, ei), ej)
           )
       
        where inv() is the invariant specified using the parameter a_invariant of the function
        Confluence_Checker::check_confluence_and_mark. In case ai is also a tau-action, the formula above can be weakened to
        the following:
       
           (inv(d) /\ ci(d, ei) /\ cj(d, ej))
           =>
           (
            gi(d, ei) == gj(d, ej) \/
            (
             ci(gj(d, ej), ei) /\
             cj(gi(d, ei), ej) /\
             gi(gj(d, ej), ei) == gj(gi(d, ei), ej)
            )
           )
       
        The class Confluence_Checker can determine whether two summands are confluent in three ways and will indicate which
        of the methods was used while proving confluence. The three ways of determining confluence are as follows:
       
             If summand number 1 has been proven confluent with summand number 2, summand number 2 is obviously confluent
        with summand number 1. This method of checking confluence is called checking confluence by symmetry. If two summands
        are confluent by symmetry, the class Confluence_Checker indicates this by printing a dot ('.').
       
             Another way of checking the confluence of two summands is determining whether the two summands are
        syntactically disjoint. Two summands are syntactically disjoint if the following holds:
        - The set of variables used by one summand is disjoint from the set of variables changed by the other summand and
          vice versa.
        - The set of variables changed by one summand is disjoint from the set of variables changed by the other summand. 
        If two summands are confluent because of syntactic disjointness, the class Confluence_Checker indicates this by
        printing a colon (':').
       
             The most time consuming way of checking the confluence of two summands is generating the confluence condition
        and then checking if this condition is a tautology using a prover for expressions of sort Bool. If two summands are
        proven confluent using the prover, the class Confluence_Checker indicates this by printing a plus sign ('+'). If the
        parameter a_generate_invariants is set to true, the class Confluence_Checker will try to prove that the reduced
        confluence condition is an invariant of the LPS, in case the confluence condition is not a tautology. If the reduced
        confluence condition is indeed an invariant, the two summands are proven confluent. The class Confluence_Checker
        indicates this by printing an 'i'. 
       
        The class Confluence_Checker uses an instance of the class BDD_Prover, an instance of the class Disjointness_Checker
        and an instance of the class Invariant_Checker to determine which tau-summands of an mCRL2 LPS are confluent.
        Confluent tau-summands will be marked by renaming their tau-actions to ctau. The constructor
        Confluence_Checker::Confluence_Checker initializes the BDD based prover with the parameters a_rewrite_strategy,
        a_time_limit, a_path_eliminator, a_solver_type, a_apply_induction and a_lps. The parameter a_rewrite_strategy
        specifies which rewrite strategy is used by the prover's rewriter. It can be set to either GS_REWR_INNER,
        GS_REWR_INNERC, GS_REWR_JITTY or GS_REWR_JITTYC. The parameter a_time_limit specifies the maximum amount of time in
        seconds to be spent by the prover on proving a single expression. If a_time_limit is set to 0, no time limit will be
        enforced. The parameter a_path_eliminator specifies whether or not path elimination is applied. When path
        elimination is applied, the prover uses an SMT solver to remove inconsistent paths from BDDs. The parameter
        a_solver_type specifies which SMT solver is used for path elimination. Either the SMT solver ario
        (http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~ario/) or cvc-lite (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvcl/) can be used. To use one of these
        solvers, the directory containing the corresponding executable must be in the path. If the parameter
        a_path_eliminator is set to false, the parameter a_solver_type is ignored. The parameter a_apply_induction indicates
        whether or not induction on list will be applied.
       
        The parameter a_dot_file_name specifies whether a file in dot format of the resulting BDD is saved each time the
        prover cannot determine whether an expression of sort Bool is a contradiction or a tautology. If the parameter is
        set to 0, no .dot files are saved. If a string is passed as parameter a_dot_file_name, this string will be used as
        the prefix of the filenames. An instance of the class BDD2Dot is used to save these files in dot format.
       
        If the parameter a_counter_example is set to true, a so called counter example is printed to stderr each time the
        prover indicates that two summands are not confluent. A counter example is a valuation for which the confluence
        condition to be proven does not hold.
       
        If the parameter a_check_all is set to true, the confluence of the tau-summands regarding all other summands will be
        checked. If the parameter is set to false, Confluence_Checker continues with the next tau-summand as soon as a
        summand is encountered that is not confluent with the current tau-summand.
       
        If the parameter a_generate_invariants is set, an invariant checker is used to check if the reduced confluence
        condition is an invariant of the LPS passed as parameter a_lps. If the reduced confluence condition is an invariant,
        the two summands are confluent.
       
        The function Confluence_Checker::check_confluence_and_mark returns an LPS with all tau-actions of confluent
        tau-summands renamed to ctau, unless the parameter a_no_marking is set to true. In case the parameter a_no_marking
        was set to true, the confluent tau-summands will not be marked, only the results of the confluence checking will be
        displayed.
       
        If there already is an action named ctau present in the LPS passed as parameter a_lps, an error will be reported. */
