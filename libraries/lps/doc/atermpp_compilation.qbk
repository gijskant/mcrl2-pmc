[section: Compiler optimizations]

One should be very careful with choosing optimization flags when compiling
code using the ATerm Library. It is reported that the -O3 flag of the g++ compiler
may result in optimizations that make the garbage collector fail, resulting in
unexpected garbage collection of terms.

[blurb __alert__ Using the g++ compiler, the -O3 flag should not be used.]
