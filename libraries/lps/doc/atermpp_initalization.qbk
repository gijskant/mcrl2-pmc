[section: ATerm Library initialization]
The `main` function of each program that uses the ATerm Library
must start with the following initialization code:

   #include "atermpp/atermpp.h"
   
   int main()
   {
     atermpp::aterm bottom_of_stack;
     atermpp::aterm_init(bottom_of_stack);
   }

The garbage collector uses the term `bottom_of_stack` to determine
which terms are candidates to be destroyed.
