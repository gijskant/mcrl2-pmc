Installation Instructions
*************************


Supported compiler suites
=========================

The following compiler suites are supported:
- GCC versions 3.4 and higher
- Apple's patched gcc distributed with XCode 2.4.1 and higher
- MSVC 8.0 SP1 and higher (except for the graphical tools)


Packages (Debian)
=================

The package names given here are used in Debian. Most of the time they are
called the same on other systems. Only top-level packages are mentioned; lower
level packages are (usually) automatically installed.

The following packages are required:
- make >= 3.80: package make

The following packages are recommended:
- wxWidgets >= 2.8.4: package libwxgtk2.8-dev or libwxgtk2.8-dbg

These packages enable the following tools:
- diagraphica (wxWidgets must be compiled with OpenGL support)
- ltsgraph
- ltsview (wxWidgets must be compiled with OpenGL support)
- squadt
- xsim

The following packages are optional:
- default icon locations: package gnome-themes, gnome-themes-extras or
  hicolor-icon-theme [optional]

Any of the default icon location packages ensures that any of the above tools
do not generate warnings on missing icons.

The following optional packages are only needed for developers:
- flex >= 2.5.4a-12: package flex [optional]
- bison >= 2.0: package bison [optional]
- doxygen: package doxygen [optional]
- python: package python [optional]

The packages for flex, bison, and python are used to generate source code.
The package for doxygen is used to generate html documentation for the web
page.


Installation (Linux, MacOS, Cygwin (on Windows), MINGW (on Windows))
====================================================================

To install the toolset to the specified directory DIR (use full names in this
path, do not use ~) with debugging information enabled, do the following:
> ./configure --prefix=DIR --enable-debug
> make
> make install

To clean up, do:
> make clean

To also remove the files generated by configure, do:
> make distclean

The --enable-debug flag is recommended, because this enables assertion
checking. This makes the toolset sometimes much slower, however. Note that the
wxWidgets package should match the --enable-debug flag.


Installation under MACOSX
=========================
In order to install the toolset under MACOS10.3 or higher the environment
variable MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET must be set to 10.3. For C shell, this can be
achieved by adding the following line to your local .cshrc:

setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.3

For bash, add the following line to your local .bashrc:

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3


Syntax highlighting (vim)
=========================

To install vim syntax highlighting of mCRL, mCRL2 and EBNF specifications, do
the following (from the root directory of the distribution):
> install -d $HOME/.vim/syntax
> install .vim/syntax/* $HOME/.vim/syntax
- add the following lines to $HOME/.vimrc to enable syntax highlighting (if
  this hasn't been done already):

syntax enable
filetype plugin on

- add the following lines to $HOME/.vim/filetype.vim to link file names to the
  syntax files by their extension:

if exists("did_load_filetypes")
  finish
endif

augroup filetypedetect
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.bnf          setfiletype ebnf
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.ebnf         setfiletype ebnf
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.mcrl         setfiletype mcrl
  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.mcrl2        setfiletype mcrl2
augroup END
