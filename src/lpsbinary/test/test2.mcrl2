% lpsbinary Test Case 2 -- #constructors of sort is exactly a power of 2
%
% Sort D has got 8 constructors, which can therefore be encoded exactly in
% a vector of 3 boolean variables. This means that all combinations of the
% boolean variables encode a constructor.
% Process parameter e should be replaced by a vector of boolean variables,
% and should be replaced in nextstate.
% The initial state should be altered accordingly.

  D = struct d1 | d2 | d3 | d4 | d5 | d6 | d7 | d8;

act a,b;

proc X(e:D) = sum d:D . a . b . X(d);
