/* To make a new view one has to make a new class derived from
 * the SimulatorViewInterface below. Views are registered at
 * the actual Simulator with the Register(View) which will
 * result in the calling of Registered of the view and possibly
 * some of the other functions to initialise the view to the
 * current state.
 *
 * Objects that are communicated between the simulator and
 * views are the following:
 *
 * - Parameters
 *   This is an ATermList containing a sequence of DataVarIds
 *   that describe the name and sort of the process parameters.
 * - States
 *   An ATerm containing DataExprs that are the values of the
 *   above parameters in a state.
 * - Transitions
 *   A MultiAct that describes some transitiion.
 * - NextStates
 *   An ATermList that consist of a sequence of pairs (or
 *   actually a ATermList of length 2) of a transition and a
 *   state that describe enabled multiaction and the resulting
 *   state.
 *
 * Note that states may contain DataVarIds. These are free
 * variables.
