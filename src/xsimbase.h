/* To make a new view one has to make a new class derived from
 * the SimulatorViewInterface below. Views are registered at
 * the actual Simulator with the Register(View) which will
 * result in the calling of Registered of the view and possibly
 * some of the other functions to initialise the view to the
 * current state.
 *
 * Objects that are communicated between the simulator and
 * views are the following:
 *
 * - Parameters
 *   This is an ATermList containing a sequence of DataVarIds
 *   that describe the name and sort of the process parameters.
 * - States
 *   An ATerm containing DataExprs that are the values of the
 *   above parameters in a state.
 * - Transitions
 *   A MultiAct that describes some transitiion.
 * - NextStates
 *   An ATermList that consist of a sequence of pairs (or
 *   actually a ATermList of length 2) of a transition and a
 *   state that describe enabled multiaction and the resulting
 *   state.
 *
 * Note that states may contain DataVarIds. These are free
 * variables.

/* Creating a dynamic library containing Views.
 *
 * It is assumed that every dynamically loaded library has the following
 * function:
 *
 *   extern "C" void SimulatorViewDLLAddView(SimulatorInterface *);
 *
 * AFter loading the library, this function is called such that the DLL
 * knowns with Simulator it is dealing with and to give it an opportunity
 * to register one or more Views at this Simulator.
 *
 * Because of the dynamic nature of these libraries, one usually wishes
 * to keep some administration of the registered Views. This is, for
 * example, necessary to be able to cleanly unload a DLL or avoid problems
 * if a library is loaded twice. For this prupose, the following classes
 * are available.
 *
 * XSimViewsDLL is a class that stores Views and the Simulator where they
 * are registered. On destruction of this class, all Views are unregistered
 * (if needed) and destroyed.
 *
 * SimulatorViewDLLInterface is a SimulatorViewInterface with some added
 * implementation to interact with a XSimViewsDLL object. The implementor
 * of a subclass does not have to worry about this, except when he gives
 * an implementation of Registered or Unregistered (see below).
 *
 * A typical DLL source file would look as follows:
 *
 *   static XSimViewsDLL *xsvdll;
 *
 *   extern "C" void SimulatorViewDLLAddView(SimulatorInterface *Simulator)
 *   {
 *     MyView *v;
 *
 *     // Create View with the main window of Simulator as parent
 *     // and show it.
 *     v = new MyView(Simulator->MainWindow());
 *     v->Show();
 *
 *     // Let view know which XSimViewsDLL he is in and add him
 *     v->SetXSimViewsDLL(xsvdll);
 *     xsvdll->Add(v,Simulator);
 *   }
 *
 *   extern "C" __attribute__((constructor)) void SimulatorViewDLLInit()
 *   {
 *     xsvdll = new XSimViewsDLL;
 *   }
 *
 *   extern "C" __attribute__((destructor)) void SimulatorViewDLLCleanUp()
 *   {
 *     delete xsvdll; // This unregisters and destroys all Views in xsvdll
 *   }
 *
 * If MyView would implement the Registered and/or Unregistered functions,
 * they need to call the corresponding functions from
 * SimulatorViewDLLInterface to assure the correctness of the information
 * in the XSimViewsDLL. This means it should look like:
 *
 *   void MyView::Registered(SimulatorInterface *Simulator)
 *   {
 *     // Call function of superclass
 *     SimulatorViewDLLInterface::Registered(Simulator)
 *
 *     // Own code
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 *   void MyView::Unregistered()
 *   {
 *     // Call function of superclass
 *     SimulatorViewDLLInterface::Unregistered()
 *
 *     // Own code
 *     ...
 *   }
