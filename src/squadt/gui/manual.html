  <h1>Overview</h1>
   The deskSQuADT application represents a framework for tool integration
   operating from the context of the user on his/her ordinary desktop machine.
   The current setup does just this but in the future it should not matter on
   what machine the tools are running, as long as a tool can be started and can
   connect to deskSQuADT.

   Underneath the graphical user interface a protocol based on XML-formatted
   messages is used to communicate with tools accross a socket connection. This
   potentially allows almost any tool written in almost any programming language
   to connect and operate witin this framework. A prerequisite is that the
   language somehow must have support for socket communication.

  <h1>Projects</h1>
   All operations occur in a project context. Within this context it is possible
   for the system to collect and store information that can be used to automate
   certain tasks for the user. Creation of a new project consits of choosing a
   separate directory called project store. Associated with the project are all
   files that are assigned to it by the user or that are generated as part of
   tool operation.
   
   The deskSQuADT application manages the contents of the project store. Files
   added by users to a project are copied to the directory and erased when they
   are removed from the project. Files generated by tools are kept in the project
   store but only if the tool that generated the file also communicated this fact
   to the framework. Note that manually copying files to the project directory
   has no effect deskSQuADt will ignore them.

  <h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
   The main screen is split into two views, a view on the data in the project,
   and an activity view.

  <h2>Data view</h2>
   This represents a limited view of the dependency graph of data sources
   (currently only files). There are two classes of data sources. The first are
   the authentic ones that have been added to the project by a user. The other
   class is made up by sources that are derived from authentic or other derived
   data. The dependencies between data sources together span a directed acyclic
   graph.
   
   It is not possible to have data sources that directly or indirectly depend on
   themselves. This limitation avoids complexity in the build/regeneration
   mechanism because there is only one way to generate each derived data source.

   The colours of files in the data view reflect the internal status of the
   data source. The colours have the following meaning:
    <dl>
     <dt>green</dt>
     <dd>file is a derived data source and up-to-date</dd>
     <dt>blue</dt>
     <dd>file is a derived data source and is not available the project store or is considered corrupt</dd>
     <dt>red</dt>
     <dd>file is a derived data source is available in the project store and not up-to-date with respect to the data sources it depends on</dd>
    <dl>

  <h2>Activity view</h2>

   The activity view shows activity of running instances of tools as well as
   tools that have finished. Each tool instances has a sub-window in the activity
   view associated with it. Such a window is called a `tool display' and is
   hidden by default. The tool display will not be visible unless a tool
   activates it in some way.

   The tool display represents a specific task that is being performed or has
   been performed. The task is performed by a single tool that is running in the
   background or has terminated already. The tool can use the tool display to
   achieve task configuration interactively by querying the user or by showing
   task progress. The tool display is <em>a</em> communication channel between a
   tool instance and the user, for richer user-interaction the tool can also
   communicate with a user through it's own graphical user interface.
