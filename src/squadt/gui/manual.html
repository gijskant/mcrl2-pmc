  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
  The deskSQuADT application provides a framework for tool integration.  In
  the current version it is only possible to run tools that are present on the
  same machine that deskSQuADT is running on. The current setup does just
  this but in the future it should not matter on what machine the tools are
  running, as long as a tool can be started and can connect to deskSQuADT.
  </p>
  <p>
  A custom build protocol based on XML-formatted messages is used for
  communication between tools and the deskSQuADT application across a TCP
  connection. This potentially allows almost any tool written in almost any
  programming language to connect and operate within this framework. 
  </p>
  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>
  All operations occur within a project context, which is used by the system to
  collect and store information that can be used to automate certain tasks for
  the user. Creation of a new project consists of choosing a separate directory
  called project store. Associated with the project are all files that are
  assigned to it by the user or that are generated as part of tool operation.
  </p>
  <p>
  The deskSQuADT application manages the contents of the project store. Files
  added to a project by the user are copied to the directory and erased when
  they are removed from the project. As part of the protocol the tool
  communicates what files have been used and what files have been produced
  during a tool run. Any file that resides in the project store that was not
  either added by the user or generated by a tool can be removed at any point
  without warning.
  </p>
  <h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
  <p>
  The main screen is split into two views, a view on the data in the project,
  and an activity view.
  </p>
  <h2>Data view</h2>
  <p> The data view shows potential sources of data and their main
  interdependencies. Currently deskSQuADT only knows about files as a data
  source and because files can be corrupted or deleted the view does not
  display data sources but how these data sources are generated.
  <!--What is
  actually stored are input/output relations, and the visualisation is an
  incomplete view on the dependency graph on data sources induced by these
  relations. -->
  </p>
  <p>
  We distinguish two classes of data sources. The first class contains what we
  call authentic sources; it is made up of files that have been added to a
  project by the user.  The other class contains derived sources which can
  always be generated by applying tools to data in the project.
  </p>
  <p>
  By design it is not possible to have data sources that directly or indirectly
  depend on themselves. This limitation avoids complexity in the
  build/regeneration mechanism; because there is only one way to generate each
  derived data source.
  </p>
  <p>
  The colours of files in the data view reflect the internal status of the
  data source. The colours have the following meaning:
   <dl>
    <dt>white</dt>
    <dd>file is an authentic data source, so it is always up-to-date</dd>
    <dt>green</dt>
    <dd>file is a derived data source and up-to-date</dd>
    <dt>blue</dt>
    <dd>file is a derived data source is available in the project store and not up-to-date with respect to the data sources it depends on</dd>
    <dt>red</dt>
    <dd>file is a derived data source and is not available the project store or is considered corrupt</dd>
    <dt>yellow</dt>
    <dd>file is being generated</dd>
   <dl>
  </p>
  <h2>Activity view</h2>
  <p>
  The activity view shows activity of running tools as well as tools that might
  have already finished. Each tool instance is associated to a sub-window in
  the activity view associated. Such a window is called a `tool display' and is
  hidden by default. The tool display is not visible unless a tool activates it
  in some way.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tool display represents a specific task that is being performed or has
  been performed. The task is performed by a single tool that is running in the
  background or has terminated already. Using the tool display the user can configure the tool to perform a task or see task progress information.
  The tool display is <em>a</em> communication channel between a tool instance
  and the user. For richer user-interaction the tool can also communicate with
  a user through its own graphical user interface.
