This directory contains a communication abstraction layer for streams and TCP
sockets (using asio). Sending and receiving messages via a socket or a
stream is performed via a single interface.

Communication is bi-directional and occurs via connections between at least two
transporters. Data travels across connections, which is either via a standard
stream or via a socket connection. Only the way in which a connection between
senders is achieved varies. Also there can be multiple receivers to a single
message (multi-casting).
