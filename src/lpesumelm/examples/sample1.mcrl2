% lpesumelm Test Case 1 -- sum variable equal to constant in condition
%
% The sum variable y is equal to 4 in the condition, hence 4 should be
% substituted for y in the summand, and sum y should be removed
% In this case, this boils down to removing sum y, and removing 4==y from the
% condition. The rest of the specification can be left untouched
act a,b;

proc X = sum y:Int . (4==y) -> a . b . X;

init X;
