% lpsuntime Test Case 4 -- One timed summand, one untimed summand,
% one true->delta summand
%
% An extra process parameter (say "lat") of type Real is introduced
% time is removed from the actions in timed summand, and the condition
% is weakened with time > lat (i.e. 2 > lat or 3 > lat in this case).
% In the untimed summand, a summation over Real (say sum tv:Real) is introduced,
% and the condition is weakened with tv > lat.
%
% NOTE: The resulting lps after untime should be equal to the one
% of test case 3

proc X = a@2 . b@3 . X
