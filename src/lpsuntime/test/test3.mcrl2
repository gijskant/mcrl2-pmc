% lpsuntime Test Case 3 -- One timed summand, one untimed summand
%
% An extra process parameter (say "lat") of type Real is introduced
% time is removed from the actions in timed summand, and the condition
% is weakened with time > lat (i.e. 2 > lat or 3 > lat in this case).
% In the untimed summand, a summation over Real (say sum tv:Real) is introduced,
% and the condition is weakened with tv > lat.
% Furthermore a summand true->delta is introduced.
