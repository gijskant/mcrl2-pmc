###################### SETTINGS ###############################################

# Whether this script is indeed called from the trunk directory will be checked
# using the following variable.
# It contains the path to this script from the trunk directory.
PATH_FROM_TRUNK=doc/doxy

# The file containing the global Doxygen configuration.
# Path is relative to the current directory, i.e. trunk.
DOXYMASTER=doc/doxy/Doxymaster

# The directory in which the website will be generated.
# Path is relative to the current directory, i.e. trunk.
OUTPUT_DIR=build/doxy

# The CSS file containing the style sheet of the website.
# Path is relative to the current directory, i.e. trunk.
STYLESHEET=doc/doxy/doxystyle.css

# The variable LIBRARY_LIST contains the list of libraries for which
# reference pages will be generated.
# Each entry is on a separate line and is a colon-separated list of the
# following form:
# [libname]:[dirname]:[path]
# where
# [libname] is the name of the library, e.g. "ATerm++" or "My Library"
#           (omitting the quotes). This name will appear in the navigation bar
#           on the website and on various reference pages.
# [dirname] is the name of the subdirectory of OUTPUT_DIR in which the reference
#           pages of the library will be stored. The directory will be created
#           if it does not already exist. Typically, [dirname] is a simplified
#           version of [libname] using lowercase alphanumerical characters
#           and underscores only, e.g. "atermpp" or "my_library".
# [path]    is the path to the library's root directory, relative to the current
#           directory (i.e. trunk).
#
# If you want to have documentation generated for your library, simply add an
# entry to LIBRARY_LIST below on a new line.
LIBRARY_LIST="
ATerm++:atermpp:libraries/atermpp
Core:core:libraries/core
Data:data:libraries/data
LPS:lps:libraries/lps

# Doxygen will extract documentation from every file/directory within your
# library's directory that is listed in the INPUT_LIST variable (if and only if
# it exists). This is a space-separated list of paths that are relative to a
# library's root directory.
INPUT_LIST="include source doc/Mainpage"

# Optionally, a Doxygen configuration file called 'Doxyfile' may be added to the
# 'doc' subdirectory of your library's root directory. If such a file exists,
# the settings in that file override the global settings in the DOXYMASTER file.
#
# For example, you can prevent specific files or directories from being
# processed by including the following line in that Doxyfile (note the use of
# '+=' as explained below):
#
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS      += [patlist]
#
# where [patlist] is a space-separated list of file name patterns that will be
# matched against the absolute path of a file. See the manual on the Doxygen
# website for more information on these patterns.
# 
# IMPORTANT: Please use '+=' instead of '=' on the line mentioned above!
# This is because the DOXYMASTER file already assigns some common exclude
# patterns, like "*/.svn/*" and "*/detail/*", to the EXCLUDE_PATTERNS variable.
# Using a '=' would assign a new list of patterns to this variable, thereby
# overwriting the patterns assigned to it in the DOXYMASTER file. A '+=' would
# merely append patterns to this list.
# 
# For a list of all variables that can be set in your Doxyfile, please refer to
# the online Doxygen manual. Note that the values of some variables should not
# be overridden if they are part of mCRL2 policy. In case of uncertainty, please
# check with the other mCRL2 library developers before overriding specific
# variable values.

# The names of the temporary PHP header and footer files.
