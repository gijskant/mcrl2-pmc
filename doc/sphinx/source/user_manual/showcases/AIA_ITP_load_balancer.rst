The AIA company is one of the world leading companies if it comes to
software for
print job distribution over document processors (high volume printers). 
The core of the software consists of 7.5 thousand lines of C code. 
In order to understand
this job distribution process better, a large part of this 
software system has been modeled and analyzed using
mCRL2. Six critical issues were discovered. 
Since the model was close to the code, all problems that
were found in the model, could be traced back to the actual code
resulting in concrete suggestions for improvement of the code.  All
in all, the analysis significantly improved the quality of this
system and led to its
`certification <http://www.laquso.com/certificates/AIA-ITP-Load-Balancer-2008>`_
by Laboratory for Quality Software (`LaQuSo <http://www.laquso.com>`_).

Technical details
-----------------
Session Layer of the load-balancer implementation was modeled in mCRL2 based on 
the C code. The underlying network socket administration layer and the upper application 
layers were modeled in an abstract way. 
 
Type of verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deadlock and safety properties violations detection by explicit state-space generation
(breadth-first search).

Data size
^^^^^^^^^
For the case of 3 clients and 1 server configuration 1.9 billion states was generated.

Equipment (computers, CPU, RAM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Large experiments were performed on an 8-way AMD 64 bit machine with 128Gb RAM. 

Models
^^^^^^
The model is available as an appendix of [EHSU07a]_
