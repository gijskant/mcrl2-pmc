ltsgraph
========

Draws a labelled transition system (LTS). A convential graph drawing is provided
either in 2D or 3D.

The main window of the tool shows the labelled transition system described by
the input file as a directed, labelled graph. Using the dialogs found in the
"Tools" menu, the graph's layout and several other visualization settings can be
manipulated. The layout of the graph can also be manipulated by dragging
vertices (states).

.. warning::

   This tool is only usable for small state spaces of up to about 200 states.
   For visualising larger state spaces it is recommended to use
   :ref:`tool-ltsview`.
