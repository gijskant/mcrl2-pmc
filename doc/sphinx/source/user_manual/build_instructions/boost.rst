Compiling Boost
===============

.. include:: toggle-platform.inc

Compiling *Boost* yourself is not recommended, unless you have ample experience
with software development, or if you simply have no other option than to compile
it yourself.

To compile *Boost* manually, download the sources to a directory that we will
call ``<BOOSTROOT>``.

.. admonition:: Windows
   :class: platform-specific win-only

   - Open the appropriate Visual Studio command prompt. This prompt can be found
     in ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin`` for Windows
     SDK 7.0 SP1.
     
     - 32bit: Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt
     - 64bit: Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command Prompt

   - In the command prompt, build *Boost* as follows::

       cd <BOOSTROOT> 
       bootstrap.bat 
       bjam address-model=64 architecture=x86 --with-filesystem --with-serialization --with-signals --with-regex 

   .. warning::

      The ``bjam`` build system is compiled by ``bootstrap.bat``, but the 
      bootstrapping system seems to have problems getting the x64 build to work
      (it unnecessarily calls ``vcvars32.bat``, which does not work in a command
      prompt that was configured for x64 development. To get around it, open a
      regular command prompt, and run
      ::

        "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /x86
        cd <BOOSTROOT>
        bootstrap.bat

      This should build ``bjam.exe``. You can now run the ``bjam`` command-line
      above from an x64 development command prompt.

.. admonition:: Mac OS X
   :class: platform-specific mac-only

   - Ensure that the shell scripts we need are executable::

       chmod +x ./bootstrap.sh ./tools/build/v2/engine/build.sh

   - Build *Boost*::

      cd <BOOSTROOT>
      ./bootstrap.sh
      ./bjam <PARAMS> --build-type=complete --layout=tagged --with-filesystem --with-serialization --with-signals --with-regex 

     For OS-X 10.6, substitute ``<PARAMS>`` with ``toolset=darwin address-model=32 architecture=x86``,
     for OS-X 10.5, use ``toolset=darwin address-model=32 architecture=x86 macosx-version=10.5 macosx-version-min=10.5``.
   
.. admonition:: Linux
   :class: platform-specific linux-only

   - Ensure that the shell scripts we need are executable::

       chmod +x ./bootstrap.sh ./tools/build/v2/engine/build.sh

   - Build *Boost*::

       cd <BOOSTROOT>
       ./bootstrap.sh
       ./bjam --build-type=complete --layout=tagged --with-filesystem --with-serialization --with-signals --with-regex 
   
After the build, Boost reports information on the build. The compiler path
specified here, must be used to set the CMake variable :envvar:`BOOST_ROOT`.
