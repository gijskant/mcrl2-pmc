The mCRL2 Trace Format is given by the following syntax.

 Bytes      Information

  0 -  9    Marker "mCRL2Trace"
 10 - 11    Version number (little endian)
 12 -       Binary ATermList representing the trace

The contents of the trace ATermList have the following form.

  T   ::=  T'  |  State |> T'  |  State
  T'  ::=  pair(Action,Time) |> T  |  pair(Action,Time)  |  T''
  T'' ::=  Action |> T  |  Action

This means that a trace is a sequence of Action/Time-pairs with at most one
State between every pair and at the beginning and end of the trace.
Actions are in the mCRL2 MultAct(<Action>*) format, Time is a mCRL2
<DataExpr> of the sort Time and States are ATermAppls with "STATE" as
function symbol and mCRL2 <DataExpr>s as * arguments.

Note that T'' is only here for backwards compatibility with the previous
untimed version.
