# Purpose of this script is an easy and reliable way of creating a source
# distribution from a checked out copy of the SVN repository. Special care was
# taken to include the following behaviour
#
#  - the script does not need to do a `make distclean' or similar, but can run
#    on a non-clean source tree while a build is in progress, without interfering
#    with this build. This ensures that a daily build process can be performed
#    using the same source tree.
#  - the distribution is tagged with a revision number that is extracted out of
#    the currently checked-out source tree
#  - build tools specific for the SVN source tree can be left out of a source
#    distribution
#
# Finally take note that this script is not meant to be portable.
