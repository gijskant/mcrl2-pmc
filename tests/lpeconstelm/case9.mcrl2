% Test Case 9 -- Free Variables
%
% In this expample we consider "case9.lpe"
% This is a modified LPE to test the fake found constants: 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% act  a;
%
% var  freevar1,freevar2: Nat;
% proc P(s3: Pos, y,x: Nat) =
%       (s3 == 2) ->
%         a .
%         P(s3 := 1, y := freevar1)
%     + (s3 == 2) ->
%         a .
%         P(s3 := 1, y := freevar2, x := y)
%     + (s3 == 1 || s3 == 2) ->
%         a .
%         P(s3 := 1, y := 2, x := 1);
%
% var  freevar,freevar0: Nat;
% init P(s3 := 1, y := freevar, x := freevar0);

% if "--nocondition" is used all summands are inspected.
% The algorithm schould indicate that x is not true.
