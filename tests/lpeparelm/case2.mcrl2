% Test Case 2
%
% The following LPE is generated:  
% 
% act  act1,act2,act3: Nat;
%
% proc P(i,z,j: Nat) =
%       (i == 5) ->
%         act3(i) .
%         P(z := i,j := 4)
%     + (i < 5) ->
%         act1(i) @ Nat2Real(z) .
%         P(i := i + 1);
%
% init P(i := 0, z := Pos2Nat(5), j := Pos2Nat(1));
%
% from this mcrl2 specification:

act act1, act2, act3: Nat;

proc X(i,z,j: Nat)   = (i <  5) -> act1(i)@z.X(i+1,z, j) +
                       (i == 5) -> act3(i).X(i, j, 4);

init X(0,5, 1);

% In this LPE process parameters j can be eliminated
% Because no occurrences of j is can be found in either an
% action, time or condition arguments.
