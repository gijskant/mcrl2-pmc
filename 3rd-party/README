This directory contains four libraries that are used by the
mCRL2 toolset. The four libraries are:

aterm    gl2ps     svc    tr

Below these libraries have a compact additional explanation.

aterm
-----
The aterm library was made by de group SEN1 at CWI in Amsterdam.
It contains routines to store and manipulate term structures. Most
of the term sorts in the mCRL2 are directly mapped onto the terms.
The terms are stored in a shared fashion, which if used properly can
reduce the term footprint in memory substantially. Furthermore, the
library contains its own term garbage mechanism, which requires 
to carefully protect and unprotect some terms.

svc
---
The system validation center (svc) format is a format to store labelled
transition systems compactly with state and label information. It was 
written by Izak van Langevelde. The labels of the transitions are ATerms.
