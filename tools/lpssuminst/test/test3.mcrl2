% mCRL2 specification, displaying a bug reported by Aad Mathijssen.
% When lpssuminst is run on this specification an error
% "error: cannot enumerate elements of sort D; it does not have constructor
% functions" is given (whereas this summand should just be ignored!)
% Furthermore an incorrect LPS is generated.
