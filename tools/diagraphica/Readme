DiaGraphica Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------

1. Download and install wxWidgets GUI library. The library is available from http://www.wxwidgets.org. The tool was tested with wx-2.6.3 but should also run under later versions.

2. Compile the tool. Navigate to the directory where 'diagraphica.tgz' was unpacked. Run Make by typing 'make' on the command line.
