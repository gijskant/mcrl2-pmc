// Studying industrial systems by simulation enables the designer to study 
// their dynamic behaviour and to determine characteristics of the system. 
// Unfortunately, simulation also has some disadvantages. These can be 
// overcome by using formal methods. Formal methods allow a thorough analysis
// of the possible behaviours of a system, parameterised system analysis and
// a modular approach to the analysis of systems. We present a case study in
// which a model of an industrial system is studied in a formal way. For this
// purpose, the model is first specified and simulated using the CSP-based 
// executable specification language χ. The model is translated into a model
// in the process algebra μCRL. This enables us to give a correctness proof
// of the parameterised model and to study the model in isolation.
