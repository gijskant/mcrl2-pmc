% lpsbinary Test Case 4 -- replacement in actions
%
% Sort D has got 2 constructors, and should be encoded into one boolean
% variable. Process parameter e should be replaced by a single boolean variable
% and the action a(e) and the initial state should be altered accordingly.
sort
  D = struct d1 | d2;

act a,b : D;

proc X(e:D) = sum d:D . a(e) . b(d) . X(d);
init X(d1);
