% lpsbinary Test Case 5 -- #constructors of sort is (n^2)+1
%
% Sort D has got 9 constructors, therefore it should be encoded in
% a vector of 4 boolean variables. Note that this does leave a lot of
% combinations of booleans that are not used (7 to be precise).
% Process parameter e should be replaced by a vector of boolean variables,
% and should be replaced in nextstate.
% The initial state should be altered accordingly.

proc X(e:D) = sum d:D . a . b . X(d);
