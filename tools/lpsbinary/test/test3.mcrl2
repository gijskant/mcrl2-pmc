% lpsbinary Test Case 3 -- #constructors of sort is (n^2)-1
%
% Sort D has got 7 constructors, which can therefore be encoded in
% a vector of 3 boolean variables. This means that there is one combination
% of the boolean variables that does not encode a constructor.
% Process parameter e should be replaced by a vector of boolean variables,
% and should be replaced in nextstate.
% The initial state should be altered accordingly.
