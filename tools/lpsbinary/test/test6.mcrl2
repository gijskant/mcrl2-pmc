% lpsbinary Test Case 6 -- Recursive finite sort
%
% Sort D is a sort with 4 constructors. It is a recursive construct of two
% constructor parameterized with sort E, which is in turn a sort which has
% got two simple constructors.
% Sort D can be coded in a vector of 2 boolean variables, in which all
% combinations are used.
% Process parameter e should be replaced by a vector of boolean variables,
% and should be replaced in nextstate.
% The initial state should be altered accordingly.

  E = struct e1 | e2;

proc X(e:D) = sum d:D . a . b . X(d);
