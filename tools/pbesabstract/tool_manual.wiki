Consider the following PBES:

  nu X(n:Nat) = val(n > 1000000) || X(n+1)

Computing <tt>X(0)</tt> depends on the computation of equations for all <tt>X(i)</tt>, for <tt>i <= 1000000</tt>. After pbesabstract, for variable <tt>n</tt>, the equation is reduced to:

  nu X(n:Nat) = false || X(n+1)

Now, an application of pbesparelm can detect the redundancy of variable <tt>n</tt>, allowing one to rewrite the above equation to the equivalent PBES:

  nu X = false || X

The latter is readily seen to have solution <tt>true</tt>. As a result, also the original equation systems have result </tt>true</tt>.
