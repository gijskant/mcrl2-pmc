 \section{Introduction}

  The mCRL2 toolset (see \cite{groote_et_al:DSP:2007:862}) is a collection of
  tools around the formal modelling language mCRL2 that can be used for formal
  verification and analysis of process behaviour.  Most of the tools have a
  traditional command line interface and today not everyone is comfortable with
  this way of working.  Therefore we started working on a tool integration
  framework to make the toolset usable for a broader audience. The idea is that
  a uniform graphical user interface should make it easier to use tools without
  having too much knowledge about the specifics of every tool.  The focus is
  simplifying the use of individual tools as well as combinations of tools and
  to automate frequently occurring tasks that involve the use of multiple
  tools.
  
  The \squadt desktop application is the graphical user interface built on top
  of the new integration framework. The name \squadt, stands for (Systems
  Quality, Analysis and Design Toolset), which refers to the kind of tasks that
  can be performed with the connected tools. The connected tools are those
  found in the mCRL2 toolset. Most of these the tools can be used stand-alone
  by means of a traditional command line interface and some with a graphical
  user interface. The only communication between the tools is uni-directional
  by means of files or file streams (also known as piping). The design of the
  \squadt graphical user interface as well as much of its functionality have,
  so far been targeted at tools with this specific behaviour.
  
  The idea of using a graphical user interface to simplify the use of a toolset
  is is not new. The \squadt application is very much influenced by the
  Eucalyptus application (see \cite{CADP}) in the CADP toolset. Eucalyptus was
  developed (around 1996) in the context of CADP for a very similar purpose as
  \squadt is for the mCRL2 toolset. However, this does not mean that all the
  underlying ideas of \squadt are the same as those of Eucalyptus.
  
  %  Ever since the first version, \squadt communicates with tools using the
  %  communication protocol described in this document.
  
  Contrary to Eucalyptus, in \squadt every action is performed in the context
  of a project. This approach is adapted from integrated development
  environments (IDE).  An IDE is an integration framework for software
  development; it integrates a number of often stand-alone software tools that
  are used for software development. In the project context \squadt manages a
  collection of files and a collection of tools that can be used to add new
  files to a project. The user observes and directs this process through a
  graphical user interface.  The core of that user interface is focussed around
  an interactive visual overview of all data dependencies within a project.
  Every dependency represents an application of a tool on a set of files with
  another (disjoint) set of files files as the result (where output depends on
  input).  Within a project \squadt keeps track of all file inter dependencies
  and uses this to monitor file consistency (which will be explained in a moment).

  Actually the adoption of the notion of project was necessary as a context for
  preserving information about how files depend on one another. One important
  use of those dependencies is the detection of possible inconsistencies
  between files.  As an illustration of the purpose consider the following
  scenario. Picture a project containing a file representing a log generated by
  a tool as a result of the task it performed. Now another tool is applied in
  the context of the same project to generate a report of this log file. For
  some reason the user decides to reapply the tool that generates the log file
  thereby updating this file.  Depending on the intend of the user the report
  is possibly no longer up-to-date (or inconsistent) with the data in the log
  file. Inconsistencies arise frequently as a result of working with multiple
  tools on multiple files. Sometimes such inconsistencies are overlooked and as
  a result the user analyses the wrong results. The idea is to help the user
  to become aware of such inconsistencies when they arise.

  Consistency is a property of two disjoint sets of files established by tools.
  A tool produces a set of output files from a given set of input files such
  that there is a certain relationship between input and output. The exact
  relation is implementation secret of the tool. As a consequence is that the
  tool that produces a file must signal the framework when it has established
  the consistency with respect to the input files. Without looking into files,
  the framework can only detect changes to files and, using file dependencies,
  deduce which files are possibly no longer consistent.
  
  Inconsistency can result from legitimate tool application within the scope of
  a project, but also from unexpected tool behaviour. A complicating factor is
  that it impossible to preserve file consistency even when no tools are
  applied. For example, hardware failure can cause corruption or a user can
  simply work around the integration framework. The only means of preventing
  unintended introduction of consistencies is by imposing restrictions on the
  behaviour of tools and the framework that controls the tools.  Tools are
  required to negotiate the use of files with the framework. This serves two
  purposes.  Firstly this ensures that the framework is aware of all input files
  to the tool, such that it can properly store dependencies between input and
  output. Secondly it avoids that the same file in the same project
  are not allowed to modify.  The best we can hope for is helping the user by
  controlling tools in a way that avoids unintended inconsistencies.
  

  
%%%  All functionality described above can in essence be obtained by an
%%%  integration system that just uses existing tools and their command line
%%%  interfaces. Making tools available in such a system would be a matter of
%%%  ad-hoc connection for instance by means of a plugin framework. This is the
%%%  approach chosen for Eucalyptus, the graphical front-end of the CADP toolset.
%%%  This approach is portable and works fine but connecting tools often takes a
%%%  lot of effort. One step further than Eucalyptus is to consider a facility at
%%%  user interface level that allows a tool to visualise task progress, and
%%%  interact with the user. This offers additional opportunities that were not
%%%  available to a tool with just a command line interface. So we decided on
%%%  using a custom communication protocol instead of existing command-line
%%%  interfaces in order to force tool builder to design new interfaces for
%%%  operating in a \squadt context.
%%%
%%%  As a matter of reference to an existing solution, a popular approach to an
%%%  interface is WSDL (see \cite{2001-WSDL}). Which is an interface description
%%%  language that is used to power web services, based on XML.  A web service is
%%%  ``a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine
%%%  interaction over a network''. Technically it is possible to use the web
%%%  services model as intermediate interface between tool and integration system.
%%%  However, because of the static nature of interface description in WSDL it is
%%%  not easily possible to read additional input or produce additional output.
%%%  Several of the mCRL2 tools create new output files based on the input.
%%%  This is not something that is easily described in WSDL.
%%%  
%%%  For tools without a graphical user interface
%%%  it would be possible to create a web service layer around the tool. For tools
%%%  with a graphical user interface this would only work. Tools with graphical user Our
%%%  focus is on a protocol for controlling tools from start to finish.

%  In abstract, the platform provides a number of facilities that can be used by
%  tools to communicate with the user. The tools provide services that are made
%  accessible to the user of the platform. The platform acts as a controller
%  (possibly for multiple tools at the same time) and therefore the system will
%  mostly be referred to as (the) controller in the remainder of this document.
%  Similarly, a tool is the communication partner of the controller.

  The remainder of this text is structured as follows. Starting with the next
  section the important concepts are introduced. This should give the reader an
  overview of things involved.  Next a high level overview of the protocol is
  presented. It specifies the structure of communication: what is communicated
  and in what way. This is followed by a more detailed description of the
  protocol consisting of design choices along with motivation and concrete
  syntax and semantics of messages by means of examples.

 \section{Concepts}

   There are lots of examples of software tools that all have different
   functionality and interfaces. Considering integration between tools is only
   useful when there is a meaningful way in which the tools can be used
   together in order to obtain a result that any of the individual tools can't.
   A tool integration framework offers a simplified way of using combinations
   of tools.
 
   To function, a tool integration framework must sit in between a user and the
   tools that are to be used. The added value is functionality that crosses the
   boundaries of individual tools. An important example of this is automation
   functionality. Automating aspects of tool use sometimes require the means to
   circumvent user interaction that would be part of normal tool behaviour.
   For this the integration framework requires direct control of tools from start to
   finish: it must function as an orchestrator.

   This section functions as introduction to the important concepts around
   which a communication protocol will be built in later sections.

  \subsection{Tool}

%   A regular English dictionary defines the meaning of the word tool as: the
%   means whereby some act is accomplished.
   A \textit{(software) tool} is a program that processes input and produces
   output that functionally depends on that input. The output of a tool is the
   accomplishment. The input and output of a tool are sets of references to
   data sources containing binary data. Considered so far are command line
   arguments, data from files in the local filesystem, data from user
   interaction through connected human interface devices, or potentially
   unbounded streams of data sent or received over a network.
   
   Inputs and outputs are \textit{concrete and persistent} if they can be
   identified by means of a Uniform Resource Identifier (or URI, see also
   \cite{rfc3305}). This means that concrete and persistent inputs are named
   objects such as files that must exist either before they can be specified as
   input to a tool, or after that a tool that produces them as output.
   
   Any tool is always used with a particular purpose in mind. Let's assume that
   the use serves the purpose (i.e. the tool is right for the job). A tool may
   serve different purposes and for each unique purpose the tool is said to
   have a \emph{function} for that particular purpose. For all thinkable
   purposes, the largest set of functions for a particular tool makes up it's
   \textit{total functionality}.

%   Modern operating systems allow programs to be executed as processes either
%   concurrently or in a time-sharing fashion. The consequence of is that a tool
%   can be running multiple times at the same moment on the same machine. Notice
%   that a tool's input and output function as communication channels between
%   processes. % where to put unidirectional requirement?

  \subsection{Task \& Task Configuration} \label{concepts::task_configuration}

%Whether the use actually satisfies the purpose depends on the
%   functionality the tool provides and how the tool is used.
   
   A \textit{task} for a tool is the use of a specific function of that tool on
   a subset of the tool's input, called the \textit{task input} and resulting
   in a subset of the tool's output, called \textit{task output}.  The sets of
   concrete task input and task output must be disjoined.  Notice that this
   excludes manipulation of input as part as output.  Finally, all concrete and
   persistent input \emph{must} be available before a task may commence, and
   concrete and persistent output \emph{must} be available after a task
   completes.

   A \textit{task configuration} for a tool is a concrete specification that
   uniquely defines a task (up to user-interaction) for that tool. The process
   of bringing a tool in the state that it can perform a task is called
   configuration. Using a task configuration, it is possible to configure a
   tool to perform the specified task.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{task_configuration.eps}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Graphic overview of the contents of a task configuration}
   \end{figure}

   % creation and manipulation (tool and system)
   \noindent A task configuration consists of a description of the set of
   inputs and outputs on the one hand and the relation between that input and
   output on the other. The environment must be able to read and interpret the
   part that specifies the task input and output. The specification of the
   function of the tool is readably as well but only important in the light of
   task repeatability. The interpretation of the latter is an implementation
   detail of the tool.
   
   % note on user interaction
%   Some tools always require interaction with the user. In such a case a task cannot
%   be unambiguously specified. The task configuration only specifies a starting
%   point from where the user interaction . The actions of the user may
%   completely change the configuration in any way.

   % note on failure
%   Since tools are programs, and programs can fail, task execution may fail.
%   Nothing can be concluded about a task that failed. If output exists it
%   must be assumed to be corrupted.

  \subsection{Display}

   To configure tools and provide feedback on tool execution, the integration
   framework requires communication with the user. Every tool connected to the
   framework must allow task configuration directed by user interaction. It
   follows that the platform must provide a facility that offers support for
   such communication.  The \textit{(interaction) display} is a tool-controlled
   graphical user interface that acts as a direct communication channel between
   a running tool and the user. Every running instance of a tool has its own
   own display that it alone controls. The display can be used for instance to
   show task progress or to query a user (e.g. for creating a task
   configuration).

   Ideal integration would present a single user interface for all supported
   tools. Naturally a tool integration framework sits between the user and a
   set of tools. Tools would use the facilities of the integration framework to
   create a (graphical) user interface for communication with the user. This
   level of integration is very nice for a user but is too restrictive for our
   purposes.  Tools that have not been developed with integration in mind, can
   still be adapted to work in the context of an integration framework.  Many
   such existing tools have their own (graphical) user interface which cannot
   easily be recreated just for the purpose of obtaining a more uniform
   interface when the tool is used from the integration framework.

%%   As an example on the use of the display consider the following scenario. In
%%   order to arrive at a task-configuration, a tool must communicate with the
%%   user. As a result \textit{the tool} produces this task-configuration.  The
%%   complete procedure is as follows. First the user selects a tool that has the
%%   functionality to complete the task at hand.  The tool is started and must be
%%   configured to actually complete that task.  The tool can gather the
%%   information it needs to produce a task configuration from the user through
%%   its interaction display. After the process of task configuration a task can
%%   be started. The tool will commence task execution during which it can use
%%   the display to inform the user about progress, or request further input.

   % added value
%   As hinted at before, the interaction display can be used for other purposes
%   than configuration. It could be used to add a graphical user interface to a
%   tool that otherwise does not have one. The tool controls the contents of
%   it's display as long as it runs. An example of its use in a
%   non-configuration setting may be giving progress indication during task
%   execution.

%  \subsection{Tool Integration}
%
%   The \squadt application is a tool for interactive software tool
%   integration.  It is built on top of a tool integration framework that
%   currently only consists of a tool control interface. The main tasks of the
%   framework are running tools and directing communication between tools
%   whether running or not. The integration level functionality that \squadt
%   provides using the framework are:
%   
%    \begin{itemize}
%     \item help guide users to find tools that offer the desired functionality
%     \item automate frequently (re)occurring tasks that involves running tools
%     \item offer a uniform way in which users can interact with tools
%    \end{itemize}
%
%   There are some more but these are the most significant ones and all have
%   directly affected the design of the tool control interface.

 \section{Protocol (high level)} \label{s:message_definitions}

  The protocol developed in this text is a part of a portable tool integration
  framework on top which the \squadt application is built. The protocol
  identifies two different parties, the controlling-side (also called
  \textit{controller}), and the side of a tool (also called \textit{tool}).
  Naturally the integration framework plays the role of controller whereas
  individual software tools play that of a tool.  The role of a tool is that a
  configurable service, that of a controller is to direct the use of a service
  on behalf of a user. The protocol provides structure for the communication
  between tool and controller, which is needed for actual configuration and use
  of that service.

  The smallest unit of communication is a message. Messages are sent and
  received in a particular order and the protocol specifies how each message
  must be interpreted. Every message is equipped with type that identifies its
  purpose.  The type indicates how the message should be interpreted and
  provides a means to specify restrictions on message order. Interpretation of
  a message is based on both it's type and the role of the party that receives
  it.

  Besides the type and the role of the receiving party, message interpretation
  is also affected by the messaging context. A message context is a chronologically
  ordered list of messages that were either sent or received by a communication
  partner.  More formal: let $p$ and $q$ be communication partners. The
  \textit{receiving context} of $p$ (pertaining to $q$) is the sequence of
  \emph{all} messages $m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, \ldots$ that were sent by $q$ and
  received by $p$ in this particular order.  The \textit{sending context} of
  $p$ (pertaining to $q$) is the sequence of \emph{all} messages $m_{1}, m_{2},
  m_{3}, \ldots$ that were sent by $p$ and received by $q$ in this particular
  order. From hereon we will assume that every message that is sent will also
  be received and that message order is preserved. More precise the receiving
  context of $p$ pertaining to $q$ is a prefix of the sending context of $q$
  pertaining to $p$.

  A basic pattern used in the protocol is a request-response sequence. The
  tool, as well as the controller, can issue a request that the other party
  \emph{must} respond to. So a request in the sending context can always be
  uniquely paired to a response in the receiving context. Besides this clear
  pattern there are also notification messages that do not require any response.

  This section provides a high level overview of the protocol in terms of: what
  is communicated when and for what purpose. The remainder zooms in on the
  different messages (by type), the purpose and structure of data communicated
  by means of such a message, and it's interpretation.

  \subsection{Notation}

   Messages are described by means of a table.
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{message name}} \\
      \hline
       message type:    & \msg{example} \\
      \hline
       direction:       & tool to controller \\
       data:            & Token \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
     \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \end{center}
   \end{figure}

  \subsection{Instance identification} \label{s:instance_identification}

   The purpose of instance identification is to identify a tool that starts
   communicating with the controller and match it with the purpose to which it
   was started.  The integration framework, that encompasses the controller,
   starts tools on demand, e.g. to allow a user to configure a task. When a
   tool is started it gets a unique token that identifies the tool instance
   (and purpose for which the tool was started).  The tool will subsequently
   initiate communication with the controller and pass back the token. The
   controller will pass on the token to it's environment (the integration
   framework) that can use it to identify the combination of purpose and
   communication parter (or tool) that was started to serve that purpose.
   
   When a tool is started it will initiate communication with a controller.  In
   practise this means that a new messaging context (connection) is established
   at the side of controller and tool.  After the connection is established the
   tool \emph{must} send an identification message containing the token it
   received.
   
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{identification notification}} \\
      \hline
       message type:    & \msg{identification} \\
      \hline
       direction:       & tool to controller \\
       data:            & Token \\
                        & \ Token = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
     \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \end{center}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent A message of this type \emph{must} be the first message in any
   receiving context of a controller. The environment must evaluate an incoming
   token and must make a judgement on its validity. If the token is not valid
   then communication with the tool \emph{should} be aborted.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_identification.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \caption{identification behaviour: controller versus tool}
    \label{fig::identification}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent The automata in Figure \ref{fig::identification} depicts the
   behaviour with respect to instance identification on the sides of controller
   and tool. The transitions represent \emph{local} actions. Some actions
   interact: \verb'receive x' on one side can only occur when \verb'send x'
   occurs on the other side (for all \verb'x'). Same for \verb'connection failure'
   and \verb'connection broken'.  Subsequent figures may use the same state
   names as in the figure above (\verb'C' and \verb'I'). These represent the
   same states with the added behaviour.

  \subsection{Capabilities}

   Capabilities represent both an information facility for one communication
   partner to learn about the capabilities of the other, as well as a protocol
   extension mechanism.  At minimum it can be used to communicate the supported
   version of the protocol between both parties. This allows for complete
   backward and forward compatibility between official protocol versions. In
   addition it allows plug-in type extension that only works if both parties
   support this.
   
   The exchange of capabilities follows the following pattern.
   
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_capabilities.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \caption{exchange of capabilities: controller versus tool}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent This corresponds with a normal request-response sequence.  Notice
   that the picture only displays the isolated communication of what is called
   capabilities. Something that is missing for instance is that in all states
   the communication partner must be able to respond to a request for
   capabilities made by the other.

   \noindent A request for capabilities looks as follows.
   
   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{capabilities request}} \\
      \hline
       message type:    & \msg{capabilities} \\
      \hline
       data:            & none \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
     \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \end{center}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The absence of data signifies the fact that it is a request. The
   partner that receives is the one that it is addressed to. The receiver
   \emph{must} send a response, which looks different for both parties. The
   controller must respond with a message that looks as follows.

   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{capabilities response (controller)}} \\
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{capabilities} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & controller to tool \\
       data:           & Version = Major $\times$ Minor \\
                       & \ Major = Nat \\
                       & \ Minor = Nat \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The data represents the version number of the protocol . The
   response of a tool looks similar but in addition to a version must also
   contains a non-empty list of input configurations. An \textit{input
   configuration} is a pair of a unique name, called a \textit{category}, and a
   non-empty list of uniquely named and typed tool input specifications. Think
   of an input specification as a single input file of which the type (or
   format) \textit{must} be known.
   
   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{capabilities response (tool)}} \\
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{capabilities} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & tool to controller \\
       data:           & Version $\times$ List (Input-configuration) \\
                       & \ Version = Major $\times$ Minor \\
                       & \ \ Major = Nat \\
                       & \ \ Minor = Nat \\
                       & \ Input-configuration = Category $\times$ List (Id $\times$ Format) \\
                       & \ \ Category = String \\
                       & \ \ Format = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The list of input configurations serve as advertisement of the
   tool's functionality, albeit in a very abstract fashion. The category is a
   descriptive name for the type of functionality that a tool offers for a
   specific list of input specifications. The list of input specifications does
   not need to contain all inputs of a tool, but just enough to distinguish it
   from other input configurations. The order of the list is significant, the
   first element, called \textit{main-input}, is treated specially. To use the
   tool, one of the input-configuration is selected and serves as the starting
   point for tool configuration (see section \ref{ss::task_configuration}).

   It is important to realise that the content of capabilities response
   messages described here represent only a bare minimum. Protocol extension
   requires extension to contents and therefore the structure of these
   messages (see section \ref{ss:structure}).

  \subsection{Task Configuration} \label{ss::task_configuration}

%   The controller makes use of the services provided by a tool through task
%   configuration. After that, the task that is performed makes use of a
%   selection of the functionality that the tool provides.  Configuration and
%   task execution are separated, the latter is discussed in section
%   \ref{ss::task_execution}.

   The task configuration process is initiated by sending the tool a task
   configuration. The task configuration represents the starting point from
   which further configuration will starts. This may seem strange because a
   task-configuration now seems to be the input as well as output of the
   process. Leaving one important question: how to obtain a task configuration
   in the first place?  The task configuration can have come into being in two
   ways.  A task configuration can be derived from an input configuration
   received as part of a tool's capabilities, or it is the result of a previous
   task configuration process.
   
   So the task configuration process is considered to be an incremental
   activity.  When a task has been configured once, one may later want to make
   changes to it. From this perspective it makes sense to allow the
   configuration process to start from an existing task-configuration. Task
   specifications can be modified again and again until a user is satisfied and
   wants the tool to execute a task. A notion of usable or completeness of
   configuration is required to determine whether a task-configuration
   unambiguously specifies a task that can be performed.  This iterative
   refinement and determination of usability are considered implementation
   aspects of the tool.

   The following figure depicts the basic (isolated) communication behaviour of
   the task configuration process.
   
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_configuration.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \caption{task configuration process: controller versus tool}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent Starting the process of task configuration with an existing
   task-configuration also opens up the possibility of errors. It is possible
   that the tool cannot use the task-configuration because it is malformed.
   Perhaps it was generated by a previous version of the tool and the current
   version can no longer use it. A tool may end the configuration process by
   sending a task-configuration paired with a judgement on whether or not that
   configuration is valid/usable.

   Let $sc$ be the sending context of a controller and $rc$ be the receiving
   context (pertaining to one tool). If both controller and tool are still
   running and every configuration message in $sc$ can be paired to a unique
   configuration message in the receiving context then \emph{no} task
   configuration is in progress. The following figure specifies the content of
   the message that initiates the task configuration process.
   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{configuration request}} \\
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{configuration} \\
      \hline
       direction       & controller to tool \\
       data:           & Fresh $\times$ Configuration \\
                       & \ Fresh = Bool \\
                       & \ Configuration = Category $\times$ List(ConfigurationItem) \\
                       & \ \ Category = String \\
                       & \ \ ConfigurationItem = id $\times$ (Option $|$ Object) \\
                       & \ \ Option = List(DataType $\times$ String) \\
                       & \ \ \ DataType \\
                       & \ \ Object = (Input $|$ Output) $\times$ Format $\times$ Location \\
                       & \ \ \ Location = String \\
                       & \ \ \ Format   = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
     \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \end{center}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The message \emph{may} only be sent when task configuration is not
   in progress.  Furthermore it \emph{must} specify a freshness marking and a
   basic configuration specification.  The marking is used to distinguish
   between configurations generated from an input-configuration (fresh) from
   those that are the result of a task-configuration process.  The basic
   configuration specification consists of a category name, a list of options
   and a list of inputs and outputs. The category gives an indication of what
   functionality of the tool is used to perform the task.  The list of options
   can be used to encode the task specification. A single option is a
   parametrised entity that represents optional configurable behaviour. The
   list of options contains the specific combination of behaviour needed to
   execute the task.

   Before sending a response the tool may initiate user interaction (see
   subsection \ref{ss:user_interaction}). The user should direct the process of
   task-configuration, unless the purpose of configuration is to repeat a task
   that has been executed before. Using the specification of \textit{Configure}
   in the figure above, a response looks as follows:

   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{configuration response}} \\
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{configuration} \\
      \hline
       direction       & tool to controller \\
       data:           & Valid $\times$ Configuration \\
                       & \ Valid = Bool \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.4cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The only difference between the request and the response is
   the validity marking. The message indicates by means of the validity marking
   whether the embedded configuration is valid. A configuration is called
   accepted if a response marks it as valid. Of course, the task-configuration
   specification in the response need not be the same as that in the initiation
   message. It represents the final configuration obtained after user
   interaction, or indeed the unchanged specification in case of an error.

   It is assumed that the task-configuration that is returned in a response has
   a strong resemblance to the task-configuration sent in the request. At the
   very least they should share the same main-input, the rest is up to the
   creativity of the tool developer.

%   \noindent About the configuration specifications: every option is uniquely
%   identified, and so is every object. The reason is to make it easier for a
%   tool developer to test for availability of options/objects.  An option
%   represents an atomic unit in the configurable behaviour of a tool. For
%   validation purposes a data type can be specified against which the values
%   for the option are matched. An object is a file associated with a format and
%   a location.
  \pagebreak

  \subsection{Task Execution} \label{ss::task_execution}

   \noindent Tool configuration is complete when the controller receives a
   configuration response message with an accepted configuration and it has not
   sent a new configuration request.  When configuration is complete the
   controller may start task execution by sending a task start signal. A task
   is called \textit{in progress} (from a controller perspective) as soon as a
   task start signal is sent, and as long as no task stop signal has been
   received. The following figure depicts this behaviour.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_task.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \caption{task execution: controller versus tool}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent Once again we note that this is isolated communication behaviour.
   Especially user interaction can take place regardless of the state that the
   controller or tool is in. A Task message has no data and looks as follows:

   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{task\_start} \\
      \hline
       direction       & controller to tool \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent On receipt, a tool \emph{must} start executing a task based on the
   last accepted configuration. After a task start signal has been received,
   execution has started and was completed, a task done signal \emph{must} be
   sent. Such a message looks as follows.

   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{task\_done} \\
      \hline
       direction       & tool to controller \\
       data            & Result \\
                       & Result = Bool \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The result represents success or failure during task execution. In
   case of failure the user should be notified. A side remark on task
   execution: the controller has the responsibility to ensure that the inputs
   in a configuration exist prior to starting a task that depends on them. Also
   it must ensure that they remain unchanged (by the environment) during task
   execution. Likewise, the outputs must not exist or be modifiable by the tool
   prior to starting a task, and it must ensure that the environment leaves the
   outputs unchanged during task execution.

  \subsection{Tool Report}

   From any context a tool can send a report that signifies a warning, error or
   just some information. The purpose is to inform the user through controller
   of individual task activities and their progress. These are detailed
   messages that are copied to a log. If for some reason a user may want more
   information about a task that is being (or has been) executed than this
   additional information can be consulted. A report message looks as follows.
   
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{report} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & tool to controller \\
       data:           & ReportType $\times$ Description \\
                       & \ ReportType = 'notice' $|$ 'warning' $|$ 'error' \\
                       & \ Rescription = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \end{figure}
   \vspace{-0.3cm}

   \noindent This facility is meant as an indirect method of communication with
   the user.  For direct communication the display facility should be used.
   Especially in the case of critical errors that force a task abort the
   display must be used rather than the reporting facility. Eventually it is up
   to the tool developer, but for the sake of user-friendliness the display
   facility is recommended.

  \subsection{Termination}

   The controller can request a tool to terminate. This facility is present to
   allow tools to free resources and remove outputs, and otherwise leave them
   in an internally consistent state. On the other side, in case of failure, a
   tool can signal that it is going to terminate, without having received a
   termination request. The following figure depicts the termination
   request-response/signalling behaviour.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_termination.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \caption{termination: controller versus tool}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent A termination request is a message that looks as follows.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:    & \msg{termination} \\
      \hline
       direction:       & controller to tool \\
       data:            & none \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \end{figure}
   \vspace{-0.4cm}

   \noindent The response \emph{must} be a termination signal, which signifies
   that the tool is shutting down and will terminate soon.  In principle a tool
   should not just terminate without request. However if termination is somehow
   unavoidable a signal of this event is better than no signal at all.  So from
   any context a tool may send a termination signal, which is a message that
   looks as follows:

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{termination} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & tool to controller \\
       data:           & none \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \end{figure}
   \vspace{-0.4cm}

   \noindent In the case that a tool fails to respond to a termination request
   within a reasonable time span, the controller may and is assumed to be able
   to forcibly terminate the tool by other means.
  \subsection{Display} \label{ss:user_interaction}

   The display is a facility provided by the controller that represents the
   primary means of a tool to communicate with the user.  Think of it as an
   interactive bulletin board controlled by the tool. The bulletin board
   notifies the tool after any change a user makes. Of course to user is not
   allowed to make arbitrary changes to content, he/she can only add or change
   data where it is the intention of the developer of the tool that owns the
   display.

   The display facility shows an arrangement of widgets (user interface
   primitives, e.g. a button), with which the user can interact. To keep it 
   simple, widgets are chosen from a preselected set of the set of very basic
   widgets. A simple relative positioning scheme is used for widget arrangement
   on the space provided by the display. A widget arrangement, also called a
   layout, cannot be manipulated. The only manipulation allowed is the complete
   replacement of a layout by another layout. The state of individual widgets,
   also called controls, can manipulated; both by the user as by the tool that
   owns the display.

   To use the display a tool must communicate the details of a set of widgets
   and the layout of those widgets. A \textit{layout specification} is a
   description of a set of widgets and how they are positioned relative to each
   other on the space made available by the display. All user interaction with
   widgets on the display is relayed to the associated tool immediately after
   the fact. On the other hand a tool can change the internal state of widgets,
   e.g. change the label of a button from "okay" to "cancel". In both cases
   information from individual widgets, called \textit{display data}, is
   exchanged between the communication partners.

   The following figure shows the communication behaviour with regard to the
   use of the display.
   
   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{t_display.eps}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-0.4cm}
    \caption{display interaction: controller versus tool}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent Notice that at the side of the controller display data can even be
   received when no display layout was communicated. This is explained as
   follows: updates to the display are modular and target a single control. If
   the target control of an update is not available then the update will be
   ignored. Because by default the display is empty, which corresponds to the
   empty layout specification, any update is ignored. A layout specification is
   communicated with a message that looks as follows.
   
   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{display\_layout} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & tool to controller \\
       data:           & LayoutManager \\
                       & \ LayoutManager = BoxLayoutManager \\
                       & \ \ BoxLayoutManager = Direction $\times$ List(Properties $\times$ id $\times$ LayoutElement)) \\
                       & \ \ \ Direction = 'horizontal' $|$ 'vertical' \\
                       & \ \ \ Properties = Visibility $|$ Input $|$ Margin $|$ Alignment \\
                       & \ \ \ \ Visibility = 'visible' $|$ 'hidden' \\
                       & \ \ \ \ Status = 'enabled' $|$ 'disabled' \\
                       & \ \ \ \ Margin = Left $\times$ Top $\times$ Right $\times$ Bottom \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Left   = Nat \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Top    = Nat \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Right  = Nat \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Bottom = Nat \\
                       & \ \ \ \ Alignment = HorizontalAlignment $\times$ VerticalAlignment \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ HorizontalAlignment = 'left' $|$ 'center' $|$ 'right' \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ VerticalAlignment = 'bottom' $|$ 'middle' $|$ 'top' \\
                       & \ \ \ LayoutElement = LayoutManager $|$ Control \\
                       & \ \ \ \ Control = ProgressBar $|$ RadioButton $|$ Button $|$ Label $|$ TextField $|$ CheckBox \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ ProgressBar = Nat $\times$ Nat $\times$ Nat \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ RadioButton = Bool \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Button      = String \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ Label       = String \\
                       & \ \ \ \ \ TextField   = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \end{table}
   \vspace{-0.4cm}
   \noindent Notice that every control is associated to an identifier ($id$),
   that \emph{must} uniquely identifies the control in this layout. The
   identifier is used to target a control in a display update.  The $box$
   element and $properties$ represent a set of constraints on the relative
   layout on what is contained in the box. A layout consists of set of nested
   box elements that contain controls.  The horizontal or vertical direction of
   a box determines the way it lays out the elements it contains above or
   beside each other respectively.

   The layout properties further affect layout of elements relative to each
   other or the containing box. Visibility determines whether a layout element
   is visible or not. Input determines whether a control is active, i.e.
   whether it responds to user interaction. Margins control the distance
   between the directly adjacent elements. For first and last elements this
   means the distance to the borders of the containing box. A box equally
   divides the amount of available space over the available controls. When
   there is plenty of space after deduction of margins the alignment can be
   used to control either the vertical or horizontal position of a control
   within the available space.

   The following message is used to communicate changes to a control on the
   display.

   \begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
      \hline
       message type:   & \msg{display\_data} \\
      \hline
       direction:      & both \\
       data:           & id $\rightarrow$ State \\
                       & \ State = String \\
      \hline
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \vspace{-0.4cm}
   \end{table}

   \noindent The interpretation of the message depends on the direction of the
   message. When a tool receives the message it is interpreted as a change in
   the state of a control on the display. When the controller receives such a
   message it is interpreted as a request to change the state of a control on
   the display. At the receiving side the message must be ignored if the $id$
   does not identify a target control.
%    A tool can change the state of controls on a display by means of their
%    identifier. The following message must be used for this purpose.

\pagebreak
 \section{Implementation} \label{s:protocol_implementation}

   The previous section specified a high level view of the protocol. At this
   point it should be clear what concepts are involved and how those concepts
   fit together. Our protocol is message based and all messages are typed.
   Parameters of interpretation of messages are its type and its origin (or
   travel direction). Not explicitly mentioned so far, but very important in
   this section is that we rely on the property that the order in which
   messages are sent is the same as the order in which those messages are
   received (or actually delivered). Another such property is that
   communication between partners uses a notion of connection.
   
   Protocol security has not been a big issue in the design of the protocol so
   far. The only place where security did play a small part is in tool
   identification on incoming connections. The details about communicating a
   token that identifies a tool are left unspecified for a reason. This step
   poses the largest security risk and leaving this behaviour unspecified
   allows to plug-in a more secure authentication scheme (which is often a
   protocol in itself) later, without modification to our protocol.

   In terms of the seven layers of the OSI model \cite{Day1983}, our protocol
   only covers the 6th (presentation) layer. All functionality below the
   presentation layer will be provided through the use of standard protocols.
   
  \subsection{Transport} \label{ss:transport}

   For the actual transport of data the TCP/IP protocol suite is the best
   contender. It satisfies all requirements discussed previously. More
   specifically, it provides: a state-full connection and preserves the order
   of messages.  Furthermore TCP/IP widely is available on many platforms and
   usable from a wide variety of programming languages.

   Other straight-forward alternatives are XMPP core (Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol, \cite{rfc3920}) and the use of pipes. The use of pipes, a
   ubiquitous operating system level construct for interprocess communication,
   has already been discussed in the introduction. The XMPP core protocol is a
   relative newcomer that is gaining popularity in all kinds of Internet
   oriented applications. The protocol is built on top of UDP/TCP and therefore
   also at the presentation layer of the OSI model.
   
   The reason for mentioning XMPP core here is that the protocol offers basic
   messaging and a request-response mechanism. Both are needed for our protocol
   so there is an opportunity for reuse of existing work. More about this in
   the next subsection.
   
%   An alternative is to use
%   standard input/output streams (or piping).  But the main disadvantage of
%   this facility is that there is not built-in support in many programming
%   languages to do non-blocking communication. This is a strict requirement
%   because of the asynchronous nature of the protocol.  A further disadvantage
%   over TCP/IP is that all communication is limited to the same machine.

%   The TCP/IP protocol suite is chosen as the recommended means of
%   transport. It is well-known and supported by a lot of programming languages.
%   The protocol requires connection-state, a tool is authenticated once and on
%   failure the connection is terminated. In addition, because meaning is
%   assigned to the order of messages, the protocol requires that messages are
%   delivered in the same order as which they were offered to the sender. All
%   requirements are all supported by TCP/IP, note that for UDP/IP this is not
%   the case.

  \subsection{Messaging}

   In the case of TCP/IP, the bottom layers of the OSI model to up to the
   transport layer offer reliability that data that is offered at the side of
   the sender is delivered without data loss in the same order at the side of
   the receiver. At the presentation level, our level, the data are messages.
   The notion of a message transcends the transport layer, so a messaging
   mechanism must break down or merge data that is delivered to messages in
   such a way that the messages that are offered at the side of the sender are
   the messages that are delivered by the side of the receiver.
   
   The first thing that is needed is the representation of a message. We have
   chosen the text-based XML format for this purpose. The use of XML is
   widespread, with an enormous variety of tools and libraries for many
   existing programming languages. This should make it easy to add the
   tool-side functionality of the protocol to tools written any popular
   programming language. So we have been searching specifically for XML-based
   protocols. 
   
   An existing XML-based protocol, also mentioned above is XMPP core.  A big
   advantage of using this protocol is that it features basic messaging and
   request response mechanism and little more than that. It is a relatively
   compact open communication protocol that that relies on TCP/IP to transport
   two XML streams (one for each direction), see \cite{Sperberg-McQueen:06:EML}
   for more information.

   The only notable disadvantage of XMPP core at the time of writing is that no
   suitable standalone implementation seems to be available that suits all of
   our needs.  Developing a full platform independent implementation ourselves
   would take too much time. We are more interested in the results obtained
   from using this protocol in the context of \squadt. So instead we use XMPP as
   an example and shall develop a messaging mechanism that stays very close to it.

%   XMPP has the notion of a message that can be sent from client to client, on
%   top of it our protocol can be implemented.   Unfortunately no single
%   client/server side implementations exist at the time that are usable on all
%   target platforms without also introducing quite a number of other
%   dependencies. Creating our own implementation would have taken to much time,
%   especially when we would have implemented all of XMPP.  So we choose a lightweight
%   custom implementation, instead of using XMPP with 3rd-party client and
%   server implementations.

%   The choice for XML is obvious we aim for extensibility and XML to some
%   extend allows changes to the format extensions to the format there is wide
%   support in many programming languages. With XML it is possible to create a
%   good parser that is to some extent resistant to extensions, meaning it will
%   also work on future versions of the format that may contain additional
%   information.  Another benefit of using XML is it makes the messages
%   readable, making it easy to print and manually verify the structure and
%   contents.

   \subsubsection{Structure of messages} \label{ss:structure}

    \noindent Messages are wrapped in the \textit{message} element. A mandatory
    attribute is \textit{type} that specifies the type of the message. The type
    attribute can occur only once. For example:
 
    \begin{verbatim}
     <message type="termination"><![CDATA[message content]]></message>\end{verbatim}

    The content of a message is wrapped as so-called CDATA section. This is an
    XML construct that is used to indicate that it's contents should not be
    interpreted as XML when parsing the document. As a consequence it is
    possible to embed non-XML(-like) documents into XML documents. This is crucial
    to allow arbitrary data to be put in messages. To make it work properly
    every instance of \verb']]>' in the message body \textit{must} be replaced by
    \verb']]]><![CDATA[]>'.
    
    Al of this means that the data inside a message is not interpreted when
    parsing a message.  The valid message types are those introduced in the
    previous section. A short summary: \textit{identification},
    \textit{capabilities}, \textit{configuration}, \textit{display\_layout},
    \textit{display\_data}, \textit{termination}, \textit{task\_start},
    \textit{task\_done}, \textit{report}.
    \\[5pt]
    \noindent In subsequent sections the structure of messages is specified for
    all the message types and for some of interesting variations. Normally the
    structure of an XML document is (formally) specified using XML Document
    Type Declaration (\cite{Sperberg-McQueen:06:EML}) or the XML Schema
    standard \cite{Malhotra:06:XSP}. Many people find both difficult to read
    and understand. So instead of using any of these standards the translation
    of the functional specification of messages the previous section to XML is
    sketched by means of examples.

%  \subsubsection{Authentication}

%   Instead of a full-featured authentication scheme we chose a simple instance
%   identification scheme. Of course security is something that should be part
%   of the design of the protocol. Security is not a main concern, so it is
%   postponed until it can be added as an extension somewhere in the future.
   
%   The only authentication that is of importance to the functioning of the
%   system that uses the protocol is identifying the peer as one of the tools
%   that was started. For this purpose the instance identification message,
%   described in section \ref{s:instance_identification} was devised. When
%   starting a tool the system must somehow pass the tool a token that can be
%   used later to uniquely identify it.

  \subsubsection{Capabilities}

   Messages for communicating the capabilities of each of the communication
   partners contain at the very least the version of the protocol. For example:

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <capabilities>
   <protocol-version major="1" minor="0"/>
  </capabilities>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent A capabilities message sent in reply to a request for capabilities by the
   controller in addition must contain the tools input-configurations. Recall
   that an input-configuration describes the main input for a relevant subset
   of functionality of the tool. So in addition the \textit{protocol-version}
   element may contain any number of \textit{input-configuration} elements as
   follows:

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <input-configuration category="editing" format="text/mcrl2" id="x"/>
  <input-configuration category="visualisation" format="text/mcrl2" id="x"/>
  <input-configuration category="editing" format="application/lps" id="x"/>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent All attributes: \textit{category}, \textit{format} and \textit{id} are
   mandatory. In the context of the pair of \textit{category} and
   \textit{format} the \textit{id} should must uniquely identify the main
   input. The \textit{category} attribute is a string which represents a name
   that characterises functionality targeted by the input configuration. The
   \textit{id} is a string that represents a unique identifier for an input
   object in a future configuration. The \textit{format} attribute specifies
   the format of this object as a MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, \cite{rfc2822}).

   The input configuration are interpreted as follows. As input tool can take a
   file that uses the text based format called mcrl2 as input, and behave
   either as an editor or as a visualiser. Alternatively it can take a file
   that stores data using the (presumably) binary lps format, and behave as an
   editor. Notice that the input identifier has value \verb'x' in all three
   cases.  The identifier only plays a role when generating a fresh
   configuration from an input configuration.

   A valid (initial) configuration can be obtained from an input configuration
   as follows.  Create a \textit{configuration} element, add a Boolean
   attribute \textit{fresh} set to true and a as child element add a single
   object (see section \ref{ss:implementation_configuration}) of type input
   with the same values for the \textit{id} and \textit{format} attributes as
   the \textit{input-configuration} element. For the first input-configuration
   above such a configuration would look as follows.
   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <configuration fresh="true" category="editing">
   <object type="input" format="text/mcrl2" id="x">
  </configuration>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize
  
   This is an example of an initial configuration, the starting point in the
   process of task configuration.

  \subsubsection{Configuration} \label{ss:implementation_configuration}

   The purpose of a configuration specification is to differentiate between
   behaviours of a tool in order to able to make a selection of the desired
   behaviour. Of course it depends on the developer of a tool, whether
   different behaviour can be observed from the outside. It also depends on the
   developer to what extend this behaviour can be selected before task
   execution is started.

   Traditionally most programs with a command line interface take arguments
   that are used to (re)produce this state non-interactively by means of a
   single string: the command line. The model behind this method of expressing
   a task-configuration is based on the idea that tasks consist of a sequence
   of operations or sub tasks each of which can be parametrised.  A
   configuration is a selection between available operations and values for the
   parameters for operations or the combinations thereof. On the command line such a
   configuration is represented as a string that consists of so-called options
   followed by values for the arguments of this option. We chose to reuse this
   model but will not use the same implementation.

   The controller is assumed to be oblivious to any data that is produced by
   tools other than the fact that there is a name associated to this data and
   the `type' of the data.  In particular the controller cannot inspect the
   data in order to obtain more knowledge about the data.

   The integration framework is the only party with knowledge about available
   data sources. This knowledge is obtained from configurations and
   communication with the user. By means of a configuration a tool informs the
   framework on what data (and its type) are produced by the task. To represent
   the type of the data the MIME standard is used. The use of MIME is
   wide-spread among desktop applications and in other communication protocols.
   The application of a tool to do a specific task is restricted by the kind of
   data the task requires as input. An example of an initial configuration
   looks as follows.

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <configuration fresh="true" category="debugging">
   <option id="-v">
    <argument type="integer">1</argument>
   </option>
   <object id="in" type="input" location="" format=""/>
   <object id="out" type="output" location="" format=""/>
  </configuration>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent The \textit{fresh} and \textit{category} attributes are mandatory.
   A \textit{configuration} element may contain an arbitrary number of
   \textit{object} and \textit{option} elements in any order, they represent
   data sources and options respectively.  The \textit{id} attributes of
   \textit{option} and \textit{object} elements represent the identifiers and
   all must be unique within the context of a task configuration (the
   containing \textit{configuration} element).

   An \textit{object} element must contain the \textit{type} attribute, which
   specifies whether the tool takes it as input or produces it as output. The
   \textit{location} attribute must specify a URI (see \cite{rfc3305}),
   and the \textit{format} attribute contains a data format specifier
   using the MIME standard.

   An \textit{option} element may contain an arbitrary number of
   \textit{argument} elements that each represent a single typed-argument to
   the option. A number of predefined types is available for arguments to
   options: string, enumeration, integer, natural, positive, real.

  \subsubsection{Display}
   
   Display manipulation is limited to replacing the entire content of the
   display at once or modifying the state of controls on the display.  In
   particular it is not possible to manipulate the layout itself. Design of a
   good user interface may require more flexibility such as separate
   manipulation of layout properties.  A good example is the combination of
   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it essentially offers this flexibility by
   means of open standards. The complexity of these standards make them
   unsuitable to directly rely on at this time.

   We have chosen a limited subset of controls that can be used by tools in
   display layouts. Layout construction itself is left very simple on purpose.
   The downside of this choice is that a tool developer has less control over
   the exact way a layout looks on the display. Within this context it has
   always been the intention of making it easy to add new controls to the
   repertoire. A detailed treatment of layout structure and the available
   controls follows.
   
%   The available elements are: \textit{box-layout-manager}, \textit{progress-bar},
%   \textit{radio-button}, \textit{button}, \textit{label}, \textit{checkbox},
%   \textit{text\_field}.  A detailed introduction of the individual controls
%   comes next followed by a description on how the controls are positioned by
%   means of a layout specification.

   \paragraph{Controls}

    It is assumed that the reader is familiar with each of the controls their
    basic function and purpose. The name and function of controls and the way a
    layout is built are based on concepts and terminology used in Java Swing.
    Every control has a mandatory \textit{id} attribute is mandatory it must be
    unique within the scope of the containing \textit{display-layout} element
    (introduced later).
   
    The following example shows a specification for a label, a button and a
    checkbox with text Cancel.
   
    \small \begin{verbatim}
  <label id="x"><![CDATA[Cancel]]></label>
  <button id="y"><![CDATA[Cancel]]></button>
  <checkbox id="y" checked="true"><![CDATA[Cancel]]></checkbox>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

    \noindent When the button is pressed or the checkbox is toggled this fact is
    communicated by sending a \msg{display\_data} message with the complete
    respective button or checkbox specification. The checkbox has a description
    and is always in one of two states: checked or not. A more complex example
    is the radio-button control, because it is not a stand-alone control.

    \small \begin{verbatim}
  <radio-button id="x" connected="y"><![CDATA[first]]></radio-button>
  <radio-button id="y" connected="x" selected="true"><![CDATA[second]]></radio-button>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent Radio buttons are always grouped and only a single button in the
   group is selected (pressed).  By default the first radio button is selected,
   if another radio button should be selected then the \textit{select}
   attribute must have value true. The radio buttons are connected by means of
   the \textit{connected} attribute that contains the value of the \textit{id}
   attribute of another radio button in the group. Every radio button in the
   group can be found by repeatedly following the \textit{connected} attribute
   to find the connected radio-button by its identifier. If the selection
   changes then only the specification of the radio button that gets selected
   must be sent by means of a \msg{display\_data} message to inform the other
   side of this event.

   The text field displays an input control for the user to input text. It is
   like the button control, but it contains an element \textit{text} that
   holds the content of the control. The following fragment shows example of
   the specification of a text field.
   
   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <text-field id="x"><text><![CDATA[100]]><text></text-field>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   Input validation may be added in the future. The framework then has the means
   to check and inform the user whether the data entered by the user matches
   the expectations of the tool developer.  For example if the input box should
   contain a number then it can be automatically checked to not contain
   non-digit characters.

   The progress bar is used to show progress to a user. It models progress by
   means of a sub range of the integer domain, specified by a minimum and
   maximum value and shows progress by colouring part of this domain up to some
   `current' value that \emph{must} be in the domain $[ minimum \ldots
   maximum ]$. The example is self explanatory:

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <progress-bar id="x" minimum="10" maximum="20" current="15"/>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent Updates to the state of a control are specified in the same way as
   in the layout specification. The \textit{id} attribute identifies the
   control of which the state is to be updated. The attributes then specify the
   new value for the attribute with the same name and child elements specify
   other aspects of the state. When attributes are missing, their value remains
   unchanged.

   \paragraph{Layout}

   A display layout specification is represented by a \textit{display-layout}
   element that contains a single \textit{layout-manager} element, called the
   \textit{top layout manager}.

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <display-layout>
   <layout-manager>
    <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="x">
     ...
    </box-layout-manager>
   </layout-manager>
  </display-layout>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

   \noindent The layout manager specifies the way in which elements are laid
   out across the display.  The \textit{box-layout-manager} has a
   \textit{variant} attribute that specifies the direction in which the
   elements directly contained in it are laid out on the available space.
   Child elements are laid out on the screen horizontally, or vertically and
   are expanded to fill space. The top layout manager completely fills the
   available space of the display. The following figure shows an example of how
   controls can be laid out using nested layout managers.

   \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{example_layout.eps}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Example layout with annotation}
   \end{figure}

   \noindent The dotted lines mark the boundaries of space allocated to
   different layout managers at the same nesting level. The picture illustrates
   the use of layout properties and how they influence the layout. A complete
   listing of the XML specification that can be used to generate the layout in
   the picture will be given later after layout properties are discussed in
   more detail.

   A number of layout properties provide more control over how elements are
   positioned and if they are visible and active (enabled/disabled). The
   available properties are: alignment, margins (as pixels) one of (top, right,
   bottom, left), vertical alignment (top, middle, bottom),
   horizontal-alignment (left, center, right), element visibility and element
   activity.
   More attention is in order for element activity. Every control can be
   enabled or disabled for user interaction. A control is \textit{active} when
   the user can interact with it. This notion is extended to layout managers
   and thereby arbitrary elements as follows. If a layout manager is inactive
   all elements it controls are inactive.
   
   Every element that is a child of a layout manager is associated with a value
   for each of the available layout properties. An implicit set of default
   values is assumed that can be used to reduce specification size.
   The default properties are as follows: alignment is left, no margins,
   elements are enabled and visible. The effective properties of an element are
   relative to that of the previous child. For example:

   \enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

   \small \begin{verbatim}
 <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="">
  <properties margin-top="1" margin-bottom="1" horizontal-alignment="right">
  <button><![CDATA[Ok]]></button>
  <properties>
  <button><![CDATA[Cancel]]></button>
 </box-layout-manager>\end{verbatim}
 \normalsize

   \noindent The layout properties for both buttons are the same, top and bottom margins
   are one pixel, vertical alignment is middle and horizontal alignment is right
   and both elements are visible and enabled. The \textit{properties} element
   directly preceding a control defines the properties for that control. If
   there is no properties element then the previous \textit{properties} element
   within the same layout manager defines the layout properties for that
   element.

   The following figures shows a non-trivial layout specification that belongs
   to the overview picture presented earlier.

   \small \begin{verbatim}
  <display-layout>
   <layout-manager>
    <box-layout-manager variant="horizontal" id="top">
     <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_top">
      <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_top_left">
       <properties margin-left="5" margin-top="10">
       <label id="alabel"><![CDATA[This is a label]]></label>
      </box-layout-manager>
      <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_top_right">
       <properties margin-left="0" margin-top="0" horizontal-alignment="center">
       <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_top_right_top">
        <properties horizontal-alignment="center">
        <button id="abutton"><![CDATA[B Button]]></button>
       </box-layout-manager>
       <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_top_right_bottom">
        <properties horizontal-alignment="left">
        <button id="abutton"><![CDATA[A Button]]></button>
       </box-layout-manager>
      </box-layout-manager>
     </box-layout-manager>
     <box-layout-manager variant="vertical" id="top_bottom">
      <properties horizontal-alignment="center">
      <progress-bar id="progress" minimum="0" maximum="1000" current="350" />
     </box-layout-manager>
    </box-layout-manager>
   </layout-manager>
  </display-layout>\end{verbatim}
  \normalsize

  \noindent Pay careful attention to the use of properties to control margins and
  alignment. Especially the default values of attributes relative to the
  previous \textit{properties} element.

  \subsection{Extensibility}

   Protocol extension is performed by increasing the major version number and
   introducing the changes. The increase in version number is supposed to make
   it easy to test whether additional functionality with respect to previous
   versions is available and/or to signal compatibility mode. The capabilities
   request-response mechanism can be used check finer degrees of compatibility.

  only communications actions are visible. The model features a single

%  \section{Conclusion}

%   The purpose of the protocol is make it possible for a user to control of a
%   tool through facilities offered by a separate system that acts as
%   intermediary. The protocol describes how a tool can be configured to perform
%   a task, how it can be made to perform this task and report the results.  A
%   task configuration comes into being by interaction with the user through the
%   system. The protocol describes this process.  The most important
%   functionality offered by the protocol is repeatability of the configuration
%   process based on a previous configuration.
   
%   The deskSQuADT application currently uses the protocol as its only method
%   for controlling tools. The most important features provided by the current
%   version are:
%    \begin{itemize}
%     \item dependencies generated by application of tools on files are
%     visualised
%     \item change propagation through (semi-)automated task execution for
%     repeating tasks; changes in input are detected and tools are re-executed
%     on request to ensure up-to-date outputs
%     \item data consistency is guarded by avoiding concurrent execution of
%     tasks that share inputs or outputs
%    \end{itemize}
%   All of these features are the result of functionality purposefully built
%   into the protocol.
   
%   Experience so far has told us that the current ability to fill and
%   manipulate the display is rather limited. Interaction with the user would
%   improve with a broader choice in controls and more fine-grained control over
%   the layout. A good example of useful additional control over layout would be
%   hiding or disabling controls in a layout when they are not needed.

%   Since the decision was made to create a custom implementation for the
%   protocol, see section \ref{s:protocol_implementation}, the XMPP protocol has
%   been formalised by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This means it
%   is now an open internet standard. Because he notion of a message is
%   approximately the same for the protocols, It was (and remains) an option to
%   use our protocol on top of XMPP.

%   It is still interesting to consider implementing this protocol on top of
%   XMPP. The latter has additional functionality that can be used to help solve
%   other tool integration problems. An example of this is active communication
%   between multiple tools through a publish-subscribe mechanism.  A future
%   extension to the protocol or perhaps even another protocol can offer such
%   functionality.
