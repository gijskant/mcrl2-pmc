  /**
   * \brief Basic component that provides information about a set of tools
   *
   * The tool manager is a special purpose database that is used to keep track
   * of a set of tools across system runs. To this end it can store and
   * retrieve tool information to/from persistent storage. Additionally the
   * tool manager provides functionality to help run, and once running, to
   * terminate tools.
   *
   * The tool manager sets the appropriate command line options and handles the
   * initial connection with the tool. A tool (instance) receives a unique
   * identifier, which is communicated as a command line argument (e.g. via
   * `--si-identifier=4' for the identifier 4). As a first act of a new
   * connection the tool communicates the identifier. Effectively it identifies
   * itself to the tool manager. The tool manager then passes through the
   * connection to the processor that requested the tool to be started in the
   * first place.
   *
   * Design choices:
   *  - a task is the unit of work it denotes the execution of a single command
   *  - the tool_manager and executor are separated such the that tool manager
   *    act as a proxy, and in the future do load balancing for a number
   *    executors that may run on different machines
