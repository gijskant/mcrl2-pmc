Follow these steps to create an FSM file for input to the visualization tools:

1. Choose an mCRL2 specification in one of the examples directories.

2. Assuming the file name of the specification is foo.mcrl2, create an LPS using
   the lineariser:
   $ mcrl22lps foo.mcrl2 foo.lps

3. Now generate a state space in mCRL2 SVC format:
   $ lps2lts foo.lps foo.svc

4. Finally, convert this state space to FSM format as follows:
   $ ltsconvert -l foo.lps foo.svc foo.fsm

Supplying the LPS to ltsconvert (via the -l option) is required to obtain
correct state parameter information in the resulting FSM file.
