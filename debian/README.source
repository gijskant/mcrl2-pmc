mCRL2 source in Debian
======================

The released source tarballs available from
http://mcrl2.org/mcrl2/wiki/index.php/Download are rather large.  This is
mainly due to the existance of 3rd-party source code that is already in
Debian.  I have removed the following from the source tree:

 * 3rd-party/boost/:  It is already available in Debian as libboost-*1.41
   (apt-get source boost1.41).
