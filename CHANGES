===============================================================================
Changes between toolset releases January 2008 and July 2008:
===============================================================================
 
 General:
   - improved command line interfaces and help information:
     + simplified interfaces of most tools, especially mcrl22lps, lps2lts,
       lps2torx, ltscompare, ltsmin, ltsconvert, tracepp and formcheck
     + improved consistency among tools
     + adherence to the GNU standard for command line interfaces
     + removed the undocumented feature that the argument '-' can be used
       for reading from standard input in or writing to standard output
     + improved error handling of loading and saving binary files
   - added manual pages for tools
   - changed SVC library license from the
     GNU General Public License, version 2 (or newer), to the
     GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (or newer).
   - libraries and header files are installed
   - improvements to existing tool and library documentation
   - improved regression testing
   - lots of bug fixes

 Added tools:
   - txt2pbes: translates a textual PBES specification to the binary format

 Removed tools:
   - pbes2bes: most functionality is incorporated in pbes2bool
 
 Renamed tools:
   - lpsdecluster is now called lpssuminst
   - lpsformcheck is now called formcheck
 
 Performance improvements:
   - improved performance of lpspp and pbespp for specifications
     involving many variable declarations
   - improved average case performance of div and mod calculations by
     a factor of 2
   - increased power of enumeration involving conditions on list length,
     e.g. enumerating all lists l such that #l == 2 or #l <= 2
   - lpssuminst: summands with a false condition are filtered out
   - lpssumelm: more time-efficient on specifications involving large
     conditions
   - squadt: more time-efficient initialisation process
 
 New functionality:
   - ltsview: added new option for marking states: mark separately for 
     every mark rule
   - ltscompare: added comparison using simulation preorder/equivalence
   - ltsconvert: added minimisation modulo simulation equivalence
   - pbes2bool, lpsactionrename, diagraphica: functional improvements
   - lpssuminst: added (option -t/--tau) which only instantiates tau summands
   - formcheck: now also works with PBESes or without a context specification

 Notes:
   - LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release cannot be used
     anymore. They need to be regenerated using the tools in this release.
   - SQuADT specific:
     + The tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools;
       to do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory.
     + Old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
       format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
       recreated manually.

===============================================================================
Changes between toolset releases July 2007 and January 2008:
===============================================================================

 General:
   - Numerous bug fixes.
   - Added documentation for all libraries and tools on the website.

 Added tools:
   - chi2mcrl2: translates a subset of Chi to mCRL2
   - lpsactionrename: selectively renames or hides actions in linear processes
   - pbesrewr: applies the rewriter to simplify data expressions in PBESes

 Removed tools:
   - lpsdataelm (its functionality has been integrated in other tools)

 New functionality:
   - Added full support for the verification of modal formulas with data using
     lps2pbes and pbes2bool.
   - Improved handling of time in the lineariser (mcrl22lps). Sometimes this
     slows the lineariser down. Added flags to suppress time if needed.
   - Improvement of the output of the pretty printers (lpspp and pbespp) that
     print linear processes and parameterised boolean equation systems.
   - Added simulation support to ltsview and improved its layout.
   - Functionality of sim is the same as that of xsim (as far as allowed with
     a command line interface).
   - Migrated from CVC Lite to CVC3 as supported external SMT-solver.

 Notes:
   - LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release cannot be used
     anymore. They need to be regenerated using the tools in this release.
   - SQuADT specific:
     + The tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools;
       to do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory.
     + Old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
       format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
       recreated manually.
