Changes between toolset releases July 2007 and January 2008

 - Added full support for the verification of modal formulas with data using
   lps2pbes and pbes2bool.
 - Improved handling of time in the lineariser (mcrl22lps). Sometimes this slows
   the lineariser down. Added flags to suppress time if needed.
 - Improvement of the pretty print functions lpspp en pbespp that
   print linear processes and parameterised boolean equation systems.
 - Added simulation support to ltsview and improved its layout.
 - Added documentation for all libraries and tools on the website
 - Functionality of sim is the same as that of xsim (as far as allowed with
   a command line interface)
 - Improvements to lpspp (pretty printer) output
 - Migrated from cvclite to cvc3 as supported external SMT-solver
 - Added tools:

    + chi2mcrl2, translates a subset of chi to mcrl2
    + lpsactionrename, selectively renames or hides actions in linear processes
    + pbesrewr, applies the rewriter to simplify data expressions in PBESes

 - Removed tools (because dataelm is now a library routine applied in
   other tools):

    + lpsdataelm

 - Numerous bug fixes
 - Notes:

    - do not use LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release;
      regenerate them with the tools in this release

    - SQuADT specific:

       - the tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools; to
         do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory
       - old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
         format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
         recreated manually
