Changes between toolset releases July 2007 and January 2008

 - Numerous bug fixes, some notes:

    - do not use LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release;
      regenerate them with the tools in this release

    - SQuADT specific:

       - the tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools; to
         do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory
       - old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
         format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
         recreated manually

 - Significant performance improvements most notably in mcrl22lps and pbes2bool
 - Added simulation support to ltsview and improved its layout.
 - Added documentation for all libraries and tools on the website
 - Functionality of sim is the same as that of xsim (as far as allowed with
   a command line interface)
 - Improvements to lpspp and pbespp (pretty printers) output
 - Migrated from cvclite to cvc3 as supported external SMT-solver
 - Added full support for verification of modal formulas with data
 - Added tools:

    + Chi2mCRL2, translates a subset of chi to mCRL2
    + lpsactionrename, selectively hides actions in linear processes
    + pbesrewr, applies the rewriter to simplify data expressions in PBESes

 - Removed tools:

    + lpsdataelm, functionality has been integrated into the other tools
