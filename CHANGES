Changes between toolset releases July 2007 and January 2008:

- Added full support for the verification of modal formulas with data using
  lps2pbes and pbes2bool.
- Improved handling of time in the lineariser (mcrl22lps). Sometimes this
  slows the lineariser down. Added flags to suppress time if needed.
- Improvement of the output of the pretty printers (lpspp and pbespp) that
  print linear processes and parameterised boolean equation systems.
- Added simulation support to ltsview and improved its layout.
- Added documentation for all libraries and tools on the website.
- Functionality of sim is the same as that of xsim (as far as allowed with
  a command line interface).
- Migrated from CVC Lite to CVC3 as supported external SMT-solver.
- Added tools:
  + chi2mcrl2: translates a subset of Chi to mCRL2
  + lpsactionrename: selectively renames or hides actions in linear processes
  + pbesrewr: applies the rewriter to simplify data expressions in PBESes
- Removed tools:
  + lpsdataelm (its functionality has been integrated in other tools)
- Numerous bug fixes.
- Notes:
  + LPS or PBES files produced with the previous release cannot be used
    anymore. They need to be regenerated using the tools in this release.
  + SQuADT specific:
    - The tool catalog must be regenerated to add newly connected tools;
      to do this manually remove .squadt/tool_catalog in the home directory.
    - Old project files cannot be loaded due to a limitation of the old
      format, automatic conversion is not possible so projects must be
      recreated manually.
